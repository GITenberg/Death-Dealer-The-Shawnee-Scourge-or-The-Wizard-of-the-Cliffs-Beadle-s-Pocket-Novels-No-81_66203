<br />THE DEATH-DEALER.</h2>
<p>It was a sultry summer day, nearly a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>The heat was almost intolerable, and man and beast sought
the cooling shade of the forest, to spend the hours until it
should in a measure abate.</p>
<p>Not a breath of air was stirring.</p>
<p>In a leafy covert, a little removed from the right bank of
the Scioto, a form lay stretched at full length upon the
earth.</p>
<p>One would have needed almost a second glance to have
told whether the object was human or brute.</p>
<p>Even then he might have said it was a cross between the
two.</p>
<p>At first sight, a Barnum or a Darwin might have gone
wild with delight.</p>
<p>The former would have thought that he had stumbled upon
a veritable &ldquo;What-Is-It?&rdquo;; while the latter would have declared
that he had at last found the long-looked-for connecting
link between the human and brute creation.</p>
<p>There was the human form, though ungainly in its shape;
but covered with hair from the crown of its head to the sole
of its feet.</p>
<p>It was indeed a second Esau.</p>
<p>A great mass of bushy hair covered his head, which, from
its appearance, had not known the presence of a comb for
months.</p>
<p>A beard of the same reddish color as his hair, and with a
like unkempt appearance, covered the lower part of his face,
and reached up over his cheeks almost to his eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>These were small and deep-set, though sharp and piercing,
and overhung by eyebrows of the same gigantic pattern as
his beard and hair.</p>
<p>A strange and forbidding appearance the man presented
about the head, and his form kept it company.</p>
<p>It was covered with the skins of wild animals, worn with
the hair-side out, so that at a glance one would have supposed
that it was his own natural covering, so much in keeping
was it with that about his head.</p>
<p>As he lay there, one could see that his form was crooked
and distorted, until it had hardly the shape of a human
being.</p>
<p>But still it was not so noticeable as it was when he was
upon his feet, and as erect as it was possible for him to be.</p>
<p>His altitude then was not more than five feet, with a monstrous
hump upon his shoulders, which, if any thing, made
him look shorter than he really was.</p>
<p>A rifle, almost as long as himself, was lying by his side,
so close that he could place his hand upon it at a moment&rsquo;s
notice.</p>
<p>A huge knife was thrust into his belt, and the hand that
rested upon the handle thereof, showed plainly that it had
the strength to use it to a purpose when the occasion warranted.</p>
<p>Though that portion of his face which was not covered
by a beard was turned to a dark brown, an observer would
have said that he was a white man, though a long residence
in the forest had almost changed his appearance and his nature.</p>
<p>The name this uncouth person had once borne was Richard
Higgins.</p>
<p>But this had been lost or forgotten long ago. His ears
had not heard that name for years.</p>
<p>When he had first appeared among the settlers along the
river, as he had done in the capacity of scout and Indian-hunter,
they had known him simply as Dick.</p>
<p>But as time wore on, another name became attached to
him.</p>
<p>The Death-Dealer.</p>
<p>The red-skins gave him that, because his hand had slain
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
more of their number than any other scout west of the
mountains.</p>
<p>So he had come to be called Dick, the Death-Dealer, and
his real name had been forgotten by any who by chance had
ever known it.</p>
<p>Along the whole border there was not a man who could
follow a trail as well as he.</p>
<p>It seemed almost as though he possessed the instincts of
a bloodhound, for when once upon the scent he never lost it.</p>
<p>No matter how much in their cunning the savages might
double upon themselves, they could not deceive him.</p>
<p>He was sure to follow them to their lair, and there obtain
the vengeance he sought, if he did not get it before.</p>
<p>Could all the red-skins he had slain rise up before him,
the number would have startled him. Yet he had slain none
for the mere love of taking life. He hated a red-skin for
the cruel deeds he done, yet he never shot one down unless
he was engaged in something detrimental to the interests of
the settlers.</p>
<p>The savages stood in mortal dread of him, and many were
the plans they laid to take his life. But thus far all of them
had failed, and he went on with his work as coolly as though
danger was a thing unknown.</p>
<p>Slowly the sun declined toward the west, and at last a
delicious coolness pervaded the forest, in place of the heat,
which had been so oppressive.</p>
<p>The scout felt its influence, and after stretching out his
limbs lazily, he arose to a sitting posture, and taking up his
rifle, he carefully examined it, to make sure that it was in
order.</p>
<p>The scrutiny revealed nothing amiss. It was in the best
possible condition, and he felt sure that it would not fail him
when he should have need to use it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Dick, it&rsquo;s about time that you were tramping,&rdquo; he
muttered to himself, as he cast a look westward and saw that
the sun had almost touched the tree-tops. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a
powerful ways to tramp to-night, and you got to make up for
the time you&rsquo;ve fooled away here. I wish I felt a little bit
clearer in my mind, as to what new deviltry the red-skins are
planning now. They&rsquo;re up to something, that&rsquo;s sure. They&rsquo;ve
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
as busy for a day or two back as the devil in a gale of
wind. They&rsquo;re hatchin&rsquo; something, and I would give a sixpence
if I only knew what it was. I must find out if I can
afore they get ready to strike. I wish thar wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t but one
blamed red-skin in the world, and he stood out yander.
We&rsquo;d jest make an end of him in no time, wouldn&rsquo;t we, Susannah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These last words were addressed to his rifle, which he patted
affectionately as though it was a thing of life and understood
what was said to it. Then he brought it to his shoulder
and glanced along the barrel toward the spot which he
had designated for the savage to stand.</p>
<p>At that very instant, as though his wish had been gratified,
a savage suddenly appeared on the very spot which he had
indicated.</p>
<p>So unexpected was his appearance, that for an instant the
scout was startled and sat as motionless in his place as though
he was a block of stone.</p>
<p>But the next moment his finger was playing with the trigger
of his rifle, and in a second more a bullet would have
sped in the direction of the savage, had he not bethought himself
of the folly of the act.</p>
<p>A score of red-skins might be close at hand, and if so what
benefit would the death of one of them be to him.</p>
<p>The savage had not seen him, therefore he remained motionless,
but with the rifle still brought to bear upon him.</p>
<p>For the space of a minute the savage remained upon the
spot where he had appeared, gazing about him as though in
some way he scented danger, and then he moved on, and the
next instant was lost to sight.</p>
<p>No sooner had he disappeared than the scout sprung to his
feet, and after listening intently for a moment, as though to
catch the sound of other footsteps, he glided swiftly away on
the trail.</p>
<p>Hardly had two minutes elapsed from the time he had
sprung to his feet, when the bushes were parted, and another
savage stepped upon the very spot where the Death-Dealer
had lain.</p>
<p>Carefully he bent down and examined the ground, and in
a moment was satisfied that it had but just been vacated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The twigs and wild grass which had been bent down by
the weight of the scout&rsquo;s body, were springing up, striving
but vainly to stand erect again.</p>
<p>This told him as plainly as words could have done that
whoever had lain there was only that moment gone.</p>
<p>The footprints about the spot told him that it was a white
man; and evidently the savage felt assured that it could be
none other than the Death-Dealer.</p>
<p>A mingled look of joy and rage came over his face, as he
glanced eagerly along the trail the scout had left behind him.</p>
<p>Only for the space of a minute did he linger about the
spot, and then glided swiftly along the trail which the scout
had been at no pains to conceal.</p>
<p>In the mean time Dick had gone out to the spot where the
red-skin had disappeared, and, taking the trail, hurried on after
him.</p>
<p>That he was on some errand of mischief, and that he was
not alone, he felt assured.</p>
<p>From the signs he had seen during the last twenty-four
hours, he knew that the savages meant mischief to some of
the settlements along the river.</p>
<p>But the exact spot where the blow was to fall he was in
ignorance of.</p>
<p>This, by following close on the movements of the savage,
who had so suddenly appeared before him, he was in hopes
to discover.</p>
<p>He little thought that another savage was watching <i>his</i>
movements full as closely; and only waiting for a chance to
take his life and secure his scalp, which would be prized higher
by him than a score of ordinary ones.</p>
<p>It would be no common triumph to boast that he had taken
the scalp of the Death-Dealer, the scout most feared in all
that region of country.</p>
<p>On went the foremost savage, all unconscious that the terrible
Death-Dealer was upon his track.</p>
<p>Straight as an arrow from the bow was his way through
the forest, and never once stepping from the trail came the
unerring scout.</p>
<p>And close behind him came the other savage, if possible
more intent upon his purpose than either of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>For nearly a mile they went on in this way, and then the
foremost savage suddenly paused.</p>
<p>In an instant the scout followed his example, hastily putting
the trunk of a tree between them so that his presence
might not be discovered.</p>
<p>The next moment the savage uttered a cry so much in imitation
of an owl that a less practiced ear than that of the
scout might have been deceived by it.</p>
<p>But he knew that it was a signal agreed upon between the
savage and his comrade, when he should have reached the
place of rendezvous.</p>
<p>Hardly had it died away before its exact counterpart was
heard away to the right.</p>
<p>A moment later it was repeated on the left.</p>
<p>The woods were full of savages.</p>
<p>So it seemed to the scout, as he stood there as silent as
death.</p>
<p>But as yet, though they came from every side, there were
none behind him.</p>
<p>Where the danger to him was the greatest, there was no
sign given to put him on his guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is a lucky hit,&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;All
I&rsquo;ve got to do is to keep quiet, and I shall find out what the
red-skins are up to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly had the words left his lips when there was a whizzing
sound like an arrow cutting the air, and the next instant
the deadly shaft was quivering in the trunk of the tree,
hardly an inch above his cap.</p>
<p>Glancing quickly about he saw the savage, bow in hand,
hardly a dozen paces from where he stood.</p>
<p>The quivering shaft told him that he was discovered, and
quick as thought he brought his rifle to his shoulder and ran
his eyes along the barrel.</p>
<p>The red-skin saw that he had missed, and turned hastily to
cover himself by the trunk of a tree. But he was too late.
The finger of the scout was on the trigger of his rifle, and
the next instant the bullet it contained was on its errand of
death.</p>
<p>The aim was an unerring one, and the leaden messenger
did its work well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>With a howl of agony, the savage went down to the earth,
never to rise therefrom.</p>
<p>His death-cry was echoed by one of rage on either side.
Two others at the same moment had caught a glimpse of the
scout, and they closed about him, determined that he should
not leave the spot alive.</p>
<p>They felt now that they had the Death-Dealer in their
power.</p>
<p>Dick knew that the odds were against him, but he was
never more cool or self-possessed in his life.</p>
<p>He had been in a good many snug places before.</p>
<p>With wondrous rapidity he reloaded his rifle, and before it
was accomplished a bullet whistled in unpleasant proximity
to his ear.</p>
<p>To remain where he was until he was surrounded by
the red-skins was no part of his plan. His only safety
lay in flight. The only red-skin close upon him could
not harm him now, for the barrel of his rifle was empty.
With a bound he sprung from behind the tree and fled away.</p>
<p>He got a glimpse of the red-skin reloading his rifle,
and had he been so minded he could have sent a bullet
through his heart. But he did not care to do it. He wished
to keep it against a time when it would do him a better service.</p>
<p>Ill-shaped and deformed as he was, it was wonderful how
fast he got over the ground.</p>
<p>His steps were rather bounds than strides, and could a
stranger have looked upon him as he fled away through the
forest they would have said that it was a wild beast instead
of a human being.</p>
<p>With fleet steps, straining every nerve in the race, the red-skins
came after him.</p>
<p>But they stood but a poor chance of overtaking him.
Their swiftest runners were no match for him in this respect.</p>
<p>He knew that as soon as the sun went down and the twilight
came on he was safe.</p>
<p>It would be easy enough to elude his pursuers then.</p>
<p>Just as the sun went down, he paused on the summit of a
slight eminence and looked behind for his enemies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Not one of them in sight.</p>
<p>But he knew that they were still upon his trail, and it
would not be long before they would show themselves, so he
waited.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br />THE WIZARD&rsquo;S DEN.</h2>
<p>One, two, five minutes passed, and the scout stood there
as motionless as stone, with his eyes fixed back over the
way he had come.</p>
<p>He held his rifle before him ready for instant use, the moment
a savage should show himself.</p>
<p>He had made up his mind that there should be one the
less to keep on his trail.</p>
<p>At last his eye caught sight of a form moving among the
trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Susannah, my girl,&rdquo; he said, as he sighted along
the shining barrel, and look quick aim upon the foremost savage.</p>
<p>The next instant Susannah spoke, in a tone that woke the
echoes of the forest, and the eye of the scout noted the savage
as he bit the dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done, my girl,&rdquo; he said, caressingly. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll
be going. By that &rsquo;ere yell, there&rsquo;s a hull snarl of &rsquo;em ahint.
Well, let &rsquo;em come on if they want to. They&rsquo;ll get a tussle
afore they get you and I into their clutches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suiting the action to the word, the scout went on again,
reloading his rifle as he went; while each moment the dusk
of evening grew in the forest, telling him that the end of
his race and the night were near at hand.</p>
<p>Ever and anon as he paused for a moment, he could hear
the savages coming on behind him, but he had no fear of
their overtaking him. In a few minutes more he would be
able to turn aside and let them go on in the wild pursuit,
while he could stand quietly by and laugh at the trick he
was playing upon them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Deeper and deeper grew the shadows in the forest, and at
last the darkness was so well down that it was all that he
could do with his eyes, accustomed to the task, to mark the
footsteps he was leaving behind him.</p>
<p>The moment had come for him to give them the slip.</p>
<p>Summoning to his aid all the energies he possessed, he
bounded forward with the speed of the wind for some fifty
rods on the course he had been following.</p>
<p>Here he paused, and listened for a few moments.</p>
<p>As he expected, there was no sound of the footsteps of his
pursuers.</p>
<p>Assured of this, he turned abruptly to the right, and, after
keeping this course for a few minutes, once more set his face
in the direction from which he had come.</p>
<p>A little later, and he heard the sound of the savages&rsquo; footsteps
as they hurried by him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go it, ye varmints,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;yer eyes have got to
be sharper than I think they are, if ye can keep the run of
my trail. Thar ain&rsquo;t nothing like darkness to get a feller out
of a fix as I knows on. It has saved you and I, Susannah,
more&rsquo;n a hundred times since we come into these parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He patted the breech of his rifle affectionately, as if it was
capable of understanding what he said. In truth he was as
much attached to it as though it had been a human companion
with whom he had spent an equal number of years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m rid of them. But I ain&rsquo;t a bit wiser than I
was an hour ago. I ain&rsquo;t got the least clue to what the varmints
are up to. Thar&rsquo;s something in the wind or there
wouldn&rsquo;t be such a snarl of &rsquo;em in these parts. There&rsquo;ll be
butchering and burning on the river somewhere afore morning,
I&rsquo;m afraid. I wish to mighty I knew where it was that
they mean to begin their bloody work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent for a few moments, turning the matter over
in his mind, and trying to determine what he had better
do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; he broke out, at length, as he gazed about
him, as if for the purpose of taking his true bearings. &ldquo;That
ere Wizard&rsquo;s hole ain&rsquo;t far from here. If he&rsquo;s only in the
right tune perhaps I can find out something by him. But,
he&rsquo;s a crafty old fox and sometimes I think he plays me
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
false. He pretends to be a friend of the whites&mdash;says he
tries to keep peace between them and the red-skins. But
I&rsquo;ve thought sometimes that he set &rsquo;em on to their devilish
work. At any rate I&rsquo;ll give him a call, and perhaps I can
fine out something. I&rsquo;m blind as a bat now, about what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few moments longer the scout remained in the attitude
of listening, and then he threw his rifle over his shoulder
and struck out at a round pace through the forest.</p>
<p>A silence most profound was around him. There was
no sign to show that another living being was near. The
savages, off the scent, had gone, he knew not whither.</p>
<p>With rapid strides he hurried on, intent upon reaching his
destination as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Away to the eastward, the sky was lighting up with the
rising moon, then a little past its full. Soon its beams would
make it as light as evening in the forest.</p>
<p>For nearly an hour he kept on without once pausing; and
at the end of that time there rose before him a high, jagged
hill, crowned with splintered rocks, and stunted trees, bathed
in the silver rays of the newly risen moon.</p>
<p>He was close upon the dwelling-place of him he sought.</p>
<p>In the heart of the hill, beneath the jagged rocks, the Indian
Wizard had his home.</p>
<p>Both the white hunters and the red gave the spot a wide
berth, for they stood greatly in awe of the strange being
who haunted the spot.</p>
<p>Of the former, none had ever held converse with him except
the scout, who now stood almost at the threshold of his
den.</p>
<p>The red-men consulted him, when any thing of great moment
was at stake; but there was not one of them who was
not glad when his back was turned upon him.</p>
<p>Sometimes they brought their sick to him to heal, for he
was reputed a great Medicine, and his skill was often of
great avail.</p>
<p>All this the scout knew well, yet he felt no fear as he approached
the spot. He had no fear of the unearthly powers
which some said the Wizard possessed.</p>
<p>Arrived at the foot of the hill, the scout paused, and
glanced up at the moonlit rocks above him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>No living thing was to be seen, and a silence like that of
death brooded around the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if the old fellow is asleep?&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve almost forgot the way into his den, and am not sure
that I can find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the solemn hoot of an owl coming from
the highest pinnacle of the cliff above, broke the silence that
reigned around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll fetch him out,&rdquo; muttered Dick. &ldquo;That bird serves
him better than a red-skin would, perched up there. His
eagle watches for him by day and his owl by night, and I&rsquo;ll
defy anybody to come round here without their knowing it.
I don&rsquo;t see how the old chap has got &rsquo;em trained so well as
he has. There he goes ag&rsquo;in. I should think that one such
a hoot as that was enough to announce anybody. But hark!
Somebody else is coming. I&rsquo;ll be darned if that &rsquo;ere bird
don&rsquo;t know more than a human.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A footstep only a few rods away had at that moment fallen
upon the ear of the scout.</p>
<p>Close beside where he stood was a huge bowlder which at
some former time had toppled down from the hight above,
and it was only the work of a moment for him to ensconce
himself behind it in such a manner that he would not readily
be discovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be hoggish, Susannah,&rdquo; he said, in a whisper,
as he placed his rifle so that it would be ready for instant
use. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let the Wizard see this visitor first. I don&rsquo;t
see who in nater it can be who dares to venture here arter
dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The footstep came nearer and nearer, and in a few moments
the scout caught a glimpse of a figure in the moonlight
approaching the spot he had just vacated.</p>
<p>To his astonishment he saw that it was an Indian maiden,
and as the moonlight fell full upon her features he saw that
she was fair and comely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is the master,&rdquo; muttered the scout. &ldquo;Who
would have thought that the old chap had such visitors as
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian girl paused upon the very spot he had so lately
vacated, and despite the lack of determination upon her
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
face, he could see mingled with it, a look of apprehension
as though she feared the interview she had evidently come
to crave of the Wizard.</p>
<p>For the space of a minute she remained motionless, gazing
up toward the spot from whence the hoot of the owl had
come. A silence most profound reigned around, and the
scout in his hiding-place almost feared that the loud beating
of his heart would betray him.</p>
<p>Suddenly a voice came apparently from out of the very
rocks, and so close to them, that they both gave a start of
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it, that seeks the Wizard of the Rocks when the
night has come? Let them speak, that he may know their
errand at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out from among the rocks as though they had opened to
give him egress, strode the once tall form of the Wizard,
now bent with years, and the strange life he led. A sort of
robe made of the skins of wild beasts covered his gaunt form
and fell nigh to his feet. His face was wrinkled and old,
but his eyes were as bright and piercing as they had been
in his youth. Age and the long life of a recluse had not
dimmed them in the least. In one hand he held a long staff,
as though to give emphasis to the question he asked. The
moonlight falling upon him gave him a weird look, and it
was little wonder that those who saw him felt that there
was something unearthly about him, and which sent a feeling
of awe to their hearts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indian girl hears the words of the great Medicine.
She has come to seek him that she may know of a thing that
is dear to her heart. She has come through the forest alone,
that no others may hear the words that may be spoken.
Will the great Medicine listen to what she has to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does the Indian girl come hither to the Hollow
Rocks, and speak with a forked tongue? Let her words be
as straight as the flight on an arrow, and they shall be hearkened
to. Why does she say that she came hither alone, while
the watch-bird up yonder tells that there were two of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indian girl scorns a lie. Her tongue is not forked
and she has not told an untruth. She came through the forest
alone, and she knows not that others are near.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>The Wizard did not speak for a moment, but he fixed his
piercing eyes full upon her face. She bore the scrutiny without
flinching, and at last as though satisfied of her truthfulness
he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tongue of the Indian was right. The watch-bird needs
more training. It has been many moons since he spoke falsely
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scout in his hiding-place breathed freer. He did not
fear harm if he was discovered, but he had a purpose in remaining
concealed for some time longer. Somehow he felt
impressed that he might learn something of the errand on
which he had come if he remained undiscovered. Besides, he
was curious to know why it was that the Indian girl had
come hither to hold a conference with the Wizard.</p>
<p>Meanwhile she stood silent, as though waiting for him to
question her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the Indian girl speak,&rdquo; said the Wizard, at length.
&ldquo;Let the daughter of the chief make known her errand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the Wizard of the Rocks knows the Indian maiden.
He calls her the daughter of the chief, and he spoke truly,&rdquo;
said the girl, proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has not heard of Minora, the Red Rose of the forest,
the daughter of Leaping Panther? Many maidens of the tribe
are fair, but none can compare with her. The eyes of Rushing
Water have seen it, and his heart is full of her. He has
asked her to go to his lodge, and she is willing. Before many
moons shall go, the young chief will have carried her thither,
and great will be the rejoicing of the tribe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strange look of mingled disappointment and hate came
over the face of the Indian girl, as these words fell upon her
ear.</p>
<p>The scout could see it from his hiding-place behind the
rock, and the Wizard noted it from the spot where he stood.
Uncertain as the moonlight was, there was no mistaking it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Wizard of the Rocks has heard the idle tale that has
been told by the tribe; or it may be that Leaping Panther
has told to his ears his hopes for his child. Moons ago this
might have been. Rushing Water did woo the Red Rose and
asked her to share his lodge with him. But his heart is
turned from her now. His love is given to another, and it is
of this that the daughter of the chief has come here to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Red Rose&rsquo;s words are strange ones. The Wizard of
the Rocks can hardly credit the words she utters. Why
should Rushing Water break his faith and turn away from her.
Where in all the lands of the red-men can he find a mate that
can compare with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rushing Water seeks not for a mate among his people.
His heart is turned away from the maidens of his own race.
He has given it into the keeping of a pale-face girl whose
lodge stands in the wilderness apart from her people. Minora
has seen her often, and she wishes now that her knife had
found her heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look of deadly hate was on the face of the girl, and her
hand as she spoke nervously sought the spot where her weapon
rested.</p>
<p>The scout gave a start, and muttered to himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She means Sam Wilson&rsquo;s cabin; and little Ruth whom
she would like to murder. Well, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve found so much
out. I guess, Min, you won&rsquo;t get a chance to murder her, and
Rushing Water, as you call him, won&rsquo;t find a bride in that
quarter. To my sartin knowledge she&rsquo;s promised to Ned
Tapley, and he won&rsquo;t be cut out by a red-skin, I don&rsquo;t believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the white maiden care for the chief?&rdquo; demanded the
Wizard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Her heart is given to one of her own race. She
will never willingly go to the lodge of Rushing Water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; muttered the scout. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s hit the truth
once, Susannah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why need the Red Rose fear, so long as the white
maiden cares not for him? Let her do her best to win back
the love she has lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Red Rose can do nothing. The time for her to work
upon his heart, has gone by. But when he brings her to his
lodge she shall die. Minora has sworn it by the Great Spirit.
To-night with his warriors he has gone to fetch his bride.
Before the sun comes again the sky will be red with the
flames of the burning lodge, and all the pale-faces will die,
but her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scout gave a start which almost brought him to his
feet. He had learned now, whither it was that the red-skins
were bound. Little need was there now to consult with the
Wizard as he had intended. Everything was plain to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>He looked eagerly about him for a chance to steal away
without being observed, but the moon was shining so brightly
that he saw that he could not do it without being observed.
So, though anxious to hurry away as soon as possible, he was
obliged to remain quiet and listen to the remainder of the
conversation.</p>
<p>The Wizard was silent for the space of a minute and then
he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rushing Water is a foolish chief. He should have chosen
for a bride one of his own people. But, why has the Red
Rose come hither? What is it that she seeks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Wizard of the Rocks is wise, and he is a great Medicine.
He knows of deadly plants, the juice of which is sure
to kill. The Red Rose would have a potion to give to the
pale-face maiden when she comes. Let it be safe and sure,
so that she shall be sent at once to the spirit-land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scout gave another start. He was so nervous now
that he could hardly keep in his hiding-place. Yet he thanked
his stars that he was where he chanced to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the Red Rose go back to her wigwam, and fear not.
Rushing Water shall never take the pale-face maiden to his
lodge. If it need be, the Indian maiden shall have the deadly
potion for which she asks. The Wizard of the Rocks will
see to it. Let her have no fears, and she shall yet live in
the lodge of the chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Red Rose is content. She knows that the great
Medicine will keep his word. When the morrow&rsquo;s eve shall
come, will he be at the Indian village?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Medicine has promised. He will be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No more words passed between them. The Indian girl
turned and disappeared the way she had come, and a minute
after, the rocks seemed to open their jagged jaws and swallow
the Wizard up again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br />THE CABIN CONFERENCE.</h2>
<p>The scout kept quiet until both of them had disappeared,
and then he rose up from his cramped position behind the
rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is a pretty go,&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;Both
sides have got their plans laid kinder cute. But I guess I
shall have a word to say in this &rsquo;ere business. Wal, we&rsquo;ll
have a reckoning some day. If I could see yer old head up
thar among the rocks, I should be tempted to put a bullet
through it. I&rsquo;ll be darned if I hain&rsquo;t a good mind to shoot
yer owl off his perch, anyway. You thought he was fooling
ye, but he wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t. I was here myself, all the time. But I
guess I&rsquo;ll let him alone. The bird ain&rsquo;t to blame, anyway.
Jest git yer p&rsquo;izen ready for little Ruth if you want to. I
guess it will be some time before you&rsquo;ll have a chance to give
it to her. It will, anyway, if I and Susannah can get to Sam
Wilson&rsquo;s cabin afore the red-skins. They&rsquo;ve got some the
start, but they can&rsquo;t come in. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no use. Dick, the
Death-Dealer, will get there afore &rsquo;em, and if they don&rsquo;t get
a good peppering out of yer mouth, Susannah, then I miss
my guess. Come on now, for we mustn&rsquo;t let the grass grow
under our feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus addressing his mute companion, Dick threw it over
his shoulder, and turning his back upon the abode of the
Wizard, he dashed away through the forest at a pace that
few could imitate.</p>
<p>Already since the moment when he had been started from
his resting-place by the appearance of the first savage that
afternoon, he had traversed many miles, a portion of which
he had been obliged, as the reader already knows, to run for
his life.</p>
<p>Still he felt not the first inclination of weariness, as most
any man would have done. His powers of endurance were
great, and he had been schooled in the work until it was a
second nature with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>The long rest he had had through the heat of the day was
greatly in his favor, and at this moment he would have said
that he felt as fresh as he did when he first rose from the
earth from his nap.</p>
<p>Of only one thing did he think he stood in need, and that
was food.</p>
<p>He had not broke his fast since morning. But he had often
gone longer than this without eating, and now there was
neither time nor opportunity for him to do so.</p>
<p>He knew that the safety of Sam Wilson and his family
depended upon his reaching their cabin as soon as he could.</p>
<p>Over two hours had elapsed since he had given his pursuers
the slip, and the distance they were in advance depended
upon how much time they had spent in searching for him
after they had lost his trail.</p>
<p>But be that as it might, he knew well that he had no time
to lose, and therefore he bent every energy to the task of
getting over the ground as fast as possible.</p>
<p>The moon had now risen high above the tree-tops, throwing
a flood of silver light down into the forest, rendering it
in places almost as light as day.</p>
<p>This was very much to his advantage, and aided him in
various ways.</p>
<p>It enabled him to avoid difficult places, where his progress
would have been slow, and it also served to keep him in a
straight line toward the place of his destination.</p>
<p>Never turning from the point toward which his mind was
set, the scout went onward.</p>
<p>But one thought was in his mind.</p>
<p>Should he be too late to save his friends from the terrible
fate which threatened them?</p>
<p>Over and over again he asked himself this question.</p>
<p>He could only answer it by hoping for the best.</p>
<p>More than once had he warned Sam Wilson to leave his
cabin in the forest and take up his abode in some settlement
where he would not be so much exposed; but he would not
listen to him.</p>
<p>He was as safe in one place as another, he always declared,
but now the hour had come when he would find out
his mistake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>It was near a half-dozen miles to the nearest settlement,
and thus he was as completely cut off from aid as though
he were in the heart of the wilderness.</p>
<p>On he went, never for a moment flagging in his pace.</p>
<p>The moon rose higher and higher, and at last he judged
from it that midnight was near at hand.</p>
<p>He could not be far from the clearing now. Were the
red-skins before or behind him?</p>
<p>The sky as yet gave no evidence of fire near at hand, and
though he paused and listened he could not hear the slightest
sound.</p>
<p>A calm unbroken by aught reigned around.</p>
<p>But it was always the stillest before a storm.</p>
<p>Would it prove so in this case?</p>
<p>From what he heard that night he could think it would be
otherwise.</p>
<p>At last the broad field of moonlight which lay through
the trees before him told him that he was close to the edge
of the clearing.</p>
<p>A few minutes more and his suspense was at an end.</p>
<p>The cabin stood unharmed in the center of the clearing,
and a light gleaming out from the window told him that they
had not all retired as yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank fortin we&rsquo;re in time, Susannah,&rdquo; he exclaimed, as
he paused for a moment to wipe the profuse perspiration
from his brow. &ldquo;I wonder what it is that keeps &rsquo;em up so
late? I wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit surprised if Ned Tapley was here
sitting Ruth up. I hope he is, &rsquo;ca&rsquo;se thar&rsquo;ll be one more
shot on our side. Ned can handle a rifle nigh about as well
as I can you, Susannah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not lose many moments here, but with long
strides he crossed the clearing and approached the cabin.
Noiselessly he came up and peered in through the crevice of
the window through which the light shone out.</p>
<p>He was right in his surmises. Ned Tapley was seated within,
with Ruth&rsquo;s head resting upon his shoulder. His arm was
about her waist, and in their happiness they had little
thought of the danger which menaced them, or that other
eyes than their own were looking upon them.</p>
<p>Dick hugged his rifle close to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re as loving as you and I,&rdquo; he said to himself.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been in pretty &rsquo;tarnal tough scrapes afore now, Susannah,
and if signs don&rsquo;t fail they&rsquo;ll be too, afore they&rsquo;re
out of this. I hate to disturb &rsquo;em but it&rsquo;s got to be done.
So here goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suiting the action to the word, he rapped loudly upon the
door, bringing the startled lovers to their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; demanded Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick. Open the door and let me in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the scout,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;Where can he have come
from at this time of night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Ned could not answer this question of Ruth&rsquo;s, he unbarred
the door, giving admittance to the scout that he might
reply for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in. I&rsquo;m glad to see you,&rdquo; exclaimed the young man,
grasping him by the hand. &ldquo;You are the last person that I
would have thought of turning up to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am sorry to interrupt yer courting, youngster, but it had
better be me than somebody else. Anyway I&rsquo;m glad to see
you here. I wish there was a dozen more from the settlement,
for I&rsquo;m afraid we shall need &rsquo;em afore morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? Is there danger abroad to-night?&rdquo;
demanded Ned, anxiously, while Ruth&rsquo;s hand which she had
placed in that of the scout&rsquo;s trembled in spite of her efforts
to prevent it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no use to try to deceive you,&rdquo; said Dick, after he
had returned the greeting of Ruth. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got the time,
even if I wanted to. Call up Sam and I&rsquo;ll tell you what I
know. But first mind that the door is barred strong. There&rsquo;s
no telling when the red-skins may be upon us, and it&rsquo;s best
to be prepared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; exclaimed the settler, emerging from the other
apartment with his rifle in his hand. &ldquo;What is the matter,
Dick? Are the red-skins on the rampage ag&rsquo;in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned had been looking to the door, and now he came
back again, and all waited anxiously for the scout to speak.</p>
<p>He did not keep them long in suspense, but in as few
words as possible he made them acquainted with the danger
they were in.</p>
<p>Though the face of Ruth was as white as snow, she did
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
not cry out, when she comprehended the danger she was in,
but the mother who had joined the group in season to hear
the burden of the scout&rsquo;s communication gave utterance to
her fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ruth, my child, what shall be done?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I
was fearful the other day when the savage was here that you
had offended him; but I did not think he would plan so terrible
a thing as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the scout, bluntly.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t trust one of the race half so far as you can see
&rsquo;em. That I found out long ago. They never enjoy themselves
half so much as they do when they are burning, and
cutting, and slashing round and raising scalps. That&rsquo;s what
they were made for I suppose, and I don&rsquo;t know as they can
help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that they are close at hand?&rdquo; asked Ned,
as he took his rifle from the corner of the room and carefully
examined the priming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I expect &rsquo;em any moment. It was a wonder that
they didn&rsquo;t get here afore me. I guess they hunted longer
for my trail than I thought they would. But they had ought
to know better by this time, than to think they could catch
me arter I&rsquo;ve got wind of what they&rsquo;re up to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What had we better do?&rdquo; asked the settler, anxiously.
&ldquo;Stick by the cabin, hadn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s all the sight we&rsquo;ve got. If we run for the
woods, like as not we shall stumble right into their clutches.
The walls of the cabin ar&rsquo; thick, and we&rsquo;ve got three rifles to
help ourselves with. We&rsquo;re safer here than we should be
anywhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is another one to help us,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;The
man up in the loft. He must be sound asleep not to hear us.
Had we not better call him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-coming,&rdquo; cried a voice, overhead. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be down
thar jest as soon as I can get my legs into my trowsers. Rot
the luck, that ain&rsquo;t the right hole anyway. I never could get
on my fixin&rsquo;s in the dark. Jerusalem! there goes a gallows-button!
Right down through a crack in the floor as sure as
preaching. Say, below there! Ye didn&rsquo;t hear it drop, did
ye?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>No answer was made to this inquiry, while the scout stared
upward for a moment as if in astonishment, and then turned
his inquiring gaze into the faces of those about him, as though
he was mutely demanding who the stranger was.</p>
<p>But they had no chance to answer him, before a huge pair
of feet appeared upon the upper round of the ladder, followed
by a pair of legs so long that Dick began to wonder if any
body would follow at all. But it did at length, crowned by
a head, and the whole of the stranger was revealed to his
wondering gaze.</p>
<p>Long and lank, it seemed to Dick as though he must be
at least seven feet in hight. He had only stopped to half
clothe himself, and the rest of his garments he carried upon
his arm. His face was sharp and thin, and the lower part
of it was covered with a long, thin beard, which stuck out in
every direction like the quills of a porcupine. His eyes,
which were small and restless, had a sharp look about them,
and his tone and twang proclaimed him at once to be a
Yankee.</p>
<p>If the scout gazed upon him curiously, the new-comer returned
it with interest. Evidently he had never seen such
an extraordinary figure as that presented by the scout. Evidently
he wished to make some remarks upon him, but he
contented himself with a single exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; demanded Dick, a little impatient of the
scrutiny the other had bestowed upon him, forgetting that
he himself had been guilty of the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, I don&rsquo;t mind telling ye,&rdquo; answered the Yankee, as
he went on with his toilet. &ldquo;My name is Peleg Parker, and
I hail from New Hampshire. I was raised in Pigwaket, right
up under the shadder of the White Mountains. I couldn&rsquo;t
make money fast enough up there, and so I took to peddling,
and so wandered away out into these &rsquo;ere parts. My pack
is up in the garret, and I&rsquo;ve got as good an assortment in it
as ever was seen this side of the mountains. Prehaps I can
trade a little with ye in the morning? Will sell cheaper
than dirt. There didn&rsquo;t any of you see that button drop
down here, did ye? I wouldn&rsquo;t lose it for a fourpence, for
I couldn&rsquo;t match it out in these parts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Mrs. Wilson replied in the negative, and then Ned Tapley
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know, perhaps, the danger we&rsquo;re in. We&rsquo;re
expecting every moment that the savages will attack the
cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, and I&rsquo;m worried nigh about to death about
my pack. If the red-skins get hold on it I&rsquo;m ruined. My
hull fortin is in it&mdash;ev&rsquo;ry darned cent I&rsquo;m worth. Say, Mister,
you don&rsquo;t think they can break in here, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was addressed to Dick, who replied somewhat angrily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t wonder if they did. They&rsquo;ll do their best
to, at any rate. You had better worry about yer scalp than
about that &rsquo;ere pack o&rsquo; your&rsquo;n. If you wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t asleep when I
came here, you wouldn&rsquo;t ask such a question as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asleep! I&rsquo;ll be darned if I&rsquo;ve slept a wink to-night. I
knew the young folks were courting down here, and it put
me in mind of the time when I used to be in that business
myself. I&rsquo;ve courted more&rsquo;n a dozen gals, off and on, up in
New Hampshire, and nigh about every one of &rsquo;em give me
the mitten in the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at it,&rdquo; muttered the scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, I thought of &rsquo;em down here for a good while, and
got a-wondering if I couldn&rsquo;t sell &rsquo;em a good bargain out of
my pack if they were going to housekeeping, and then I
rolled over and was just going to sleep, when you made that
thundering racket at the door. And now here I am up
ag&rsquo;in without having got a wink of sleep to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be lucky if you ever do again,&rdquo; muttered the scout.
&ldquo;If we can&rsquo;t keep the red-skins out of here, you&rsquo;ve taken
your last nap and cheated the last one you ever will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Yankee was about to make some rejoinder to this,
when Sam Wilson broke in:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do for us to stand talking here. We must
keep a watch without. I will go up into the loft and station
myself at one of the loopholes there. We mustn&rsquo;t let the
red-skins get up under the walls of the cabin unless we want
to be smoked out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; said Ned, making a move toward the ladder.
&ldquo;Do you stay here and make ready for their coming. I&rsquo;ll
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
keep my eyes open, and give the alarm the first glimpse I
get on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swan, I wish I was in New Hampshire,&rdquo; exclaimed Peleg.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a dollar that &rsquo;ere pack will go afore I get out
of this scrape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you got for weapons?&rdquo; demanded the scout,
sharply. &ldquo;We shall have need of every thing in that line
afore morning. Have you got a rifle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How in the name of Jerusalem do you think I can carry
a rifle along with a pack? I guess you never was in the
peddling line, was ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I thought. And jest at this time I wish I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
neither. I guess it would be money in my pocket if I was
out of this scrape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what have you got?&rdquo; demanded the scout, impatiently.
&ldquo;Any pistols?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a pair of beauties up in my pack. But I don&rsquo;t want
to dirt &rsquo;em up in this scrape if I can help it. I calculated
to make a good thing out of &rsquo;em when I found the right
customer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick gave utterance to something which sounded very
much like an oath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a customer for &rsquo;em now, and if you save yer
scalp in the trade you&rsquo;ll make the best bargain you ever did.
Bring them down and load them up at once. We ain&rsquo;t got
a moment to lose in getting ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With evident reluctance the Yankee turned away and
clambered once more up to the loft. It took him some little
time to search them out in the dark, but when he returned
he had them in his hands.</p>
<p>The scout took them from him, for the purpose of examining
them to see if they were properly loaded and in good
order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Peleg. &ldquo;What will you give me for &rsquo;em?
I&rsquo;ll sell &rsquo;em &rsquo;tarnal cheap. Speak out. I stump you to make
me an offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of footsteps was heard above their heads, and
the next moment the excited face of Ned was thrust down
through the opening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are coming; a half-score of them at least are
crossing the clearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilson and Ruth grew paler if possible than before,
while Sam and the scout exchanged glances, which told of
the apprehension they felt. As for the Yankee, he only
muttered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darn it, why couldn&rsquo;t they have waited a minute longer.
They&rsquo;ve sp&rsquo;iled a trade.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br />FOUR AGAINST FORTY.</h2>
<p>It was only for a moment that the look of apprehension
remained upon the face of the scout. Then it vanished and
a look of stern determination took its place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look well to the door, Sam,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a crack
there atween the logs by it, and if you get a good chance
give &rsquo;em a shot that will tell. I&rsquo;ll go up with Ned, and if we
don&rsquo;t pick off a couple of &rsquo;em at least afore they get here,
why we&rsquo;ll make some bad shots, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; said the Yankee. &ldquo;Keep the wimmin
folks company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay here with Sam, and if you find a chance to use
them shooters, why <i>do</i> it,&rdquo; said Dick, as he bounded up the
ladder, and felt his way along to the spot where Ned Tapley
was kneeling before a loophole which had been left between
the logs for the very purpose for which it was now
employed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said the young man, moving aside so as to give
him a chance to peer into the outer world. &ldquo;There is more
of them than I thought. As near as I can make out there
is a good two score of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there is,&rdquo; said Dick, as he glanced hastily through
and noted the red-skins that as silently as so many spirits of
evil were gliding toward the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rushing Water has got half his warriors with him, I
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
guess. He don&rsquo;t mean to fail in this thing if he can help
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am afraid that he will not,&rdquo; said Ned, in a low
tone. &ldquo;How can we ever contend against such a horde as
that which is pouring down upon us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the cabin walls only prove true to us, we will make
a good fight, and send howling away what we don&rsquo;t leave
stretched out about us. So here goes for one of &rsquo;em, Susannah.
Mind, old gal, that you do yer duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thrust the muzzle of his rifle out between the logs and
ran his eye along the barrel. Taking good aim upon the
foremost savage, he pulled the trigger. There was a report
and the savage lay stretched upon the earth.</p>
<p>A shout of rage burst from the throats of the savages, making
the echoes of the forest ring on every side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one of them gone under,&rdquo; said the scout, exultingly.
&ldquo;Hear them howl. But they shall have a chance
to again before we are done with them. Now, Ned, here is a
chance for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He moved aside, hastily reloading his rifle as he did so,
and the young man took his place. A glance without showed
him that the savages had widely separated, and were
hurrying at the top of their speed toward the cabin.</p>
<p>They knew that when once beneath its walls that the
marksmen within would not have the chance upon them that
they had now.</p>
<p>Ned singled out one of them, and brought his rifle to bear
upon him. The next instant, and the messenger of death
sped forth upon its errand of destruction, and when the
smoke cleared away he saw the savage lying motionless upon
the field.</p>
<p>Another moment, and Sam&rsquo;s rifle spoke from beneath
them, and glancing out Ned saw that he, too, had been successful.</p>
<p>The scout&rsquo;s rifle was reloaded now, and Ned hastily moved
away to give him another chance. But, it was too late.
The field between the cabin and the clearing was emptied of
savages, except those who would never move again. They
had gained the shelter of the cabin walls, and each felt a
shudder run through his frame, as he thought how near the
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
savage horde was to them, and only the walls of their little
fort between them and destruction.</p>
<p>Were it not for the helpless women, and the terrible fate
which threatened Ruth, they would hardly have given their
situation a thought. Both had been in a tight fix before, and
this time if it was fated that they were to go under, why they
would do so with the best grace they could. But they
would not give up so long as they had life and strength left
them.</p>
<p>Dick withdrew his rifle and stepped back from the loophole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay here, Ned, and keep a good look without. It may be
that you will get a shot at one of the varmints by and by
when they are getting kinder keerless. I&rsquo;ll go down and see
what Sam and that long-legged Yankee are up to. To my
mind the red-skins will be trying the door afore long. There!
I knew they would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he uttered these words, the flooring beneath their feet
trembled, and there came a sound from the outside as though
a blow had been dealt with great force against the cabin.</p>
<p>Hurriedly Dick descended the ladder, and joined Sam,
whose form he made out standing by the door.</p>
<p>The light had been extinguished so that the savages could
not see what was passing within the cabin.</p>
<p>The darkness hid the forms of Ruth and her mother, and
that of the Yankee was invisible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Sam, how goes it?&rdquo; he demanded, in a low tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so far,&rdquo; returned the settler. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done for one
of &rsquo;em, and you and Ned for two more. They&rsquo;ve tried the
door once, but they did not stir it a peg. I should think a
half dozen of them threw themselves against it at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment another blow fell upon it, causing it to
start back a little, for the instant; only to firmly resume its
place when the force of the blow was spent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It stands it bravely,&rdquo; exclaimed the scout. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
got to put on more force than that if they break in here. I
guess you built that door, Sam, for jest such a time as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they won&rsquo;t get in,&rdquo; exclaimed a voice from a dark
corner of the apartment. &ldquo;If they should and carry off my
pack, I&rsquo;m a ruined man. Say, mister, what will you give
me for it now, and take yer chances?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;You had better worry about yer scalp than that pack of
your&rsquo;n,&rdquo; returned the scout. &ldquo;If you lose that, I don&rsquo;t think
yer knick-nacks will amount to much to ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, I wish I was in New Hampshire! What a &rsquo;tarnal
fool I was to come out here anyway! Aunt Betsey alwa&rsquo;s
told me that a rolling stone gathered no moss. I wish I had
sot down as flat as the big rock in the sheep-pasture afore I
had come out here. Jerusalem! but I du believe they will
stave the house down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another blow had fallen upon the door with such tremendous
force, that it had started a little inward, throwing down
the barricade of movable articles which had been piled against
it to help strengthen it, making such a clatter that the Yankee
asked if the side of the cabin was falling in.</p>
<p>But still the door was not driven from its place, and hastily
the two men went to building up the barricade again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They used a log of wood that time,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;But
they have got to deal it a heavier blow than that, before they
will batter it down. I may be mistaken, but I think it is good
for all they can bring against it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;But they are in earnest about
getting in here, and I&rsquo;m afraid they will, some way. Rushing
Water will tear this cabin to pieces, but what he will get
Ruth into his hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But while I live, or so long as one log lays upon another,
he shall never have my child,&rdquo; said the settler, in a low, determined
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I say amen to that,&rdquo; said Dick, fervently. &ldquo;The
Death-Dealer has not gone under yet, and while he has life
he will not leave her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven bless you,&rdquo; said the settler. &ldquo;Had it not been
for you we should have been butchered by this time, and
Ruth in their power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again and again the blows descended upon the door, but it
resisted them stoutly, and at last the savages apparently made
up their minds they could not gain an entrance in this way.</p>
<p>Therefore the blows ceased, and for the space of five minutes
not a sound came from without.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilson and Ruth came forward from the spot where
they had been anxiously waiting the course of events.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;What means this silence, father?&rdquo; said the latter, in a low
tone. &ldquo;Do you think they have given it up and gone
away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gi&rsquo;n it up? No, not by a jug-full,&rdquo; exclaimed the scout,
speaking before the settler could answer. &ldquo;I tell you they
won&rsquo;t give it up so easily. They&rsquo;re planning some new sort
of deviltry. That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re up to. I know the varmints
pretty well and they won&rsquo;t leave this spot in a hurry unless
we make it too hot to hold &rsquo;em, and the chances are that
they&rsquo;ll make it too <i>hot</i> for us. Thar, Ned&rsquo;s picked off another
of &rsquo;em, I&rsquo;ll be bound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report of a rifle rung out above their heads, and hardly
had it died away before the voice of Ned was heard summoning
the scout to him.</p>
<p>Dick bounded up the ladder, and in a moment was at his
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look. They&rsquo;re going to see what fire will do to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scout uttered an exclamation of alarm, and bending
down, peered out through the loophole. A glance showed
him that the words of Ned were true.</p>
<p>A huge stack of straw, which stood a little way off, had
been brought and heaped against the side of the cabin.</p>
<p>This he saw at a glance, and the next moment all was
darkness without.</p>
<p>The moon had managed to struggle for a moment through
the great mass of black clouds which had suddenly covered
the sky, giving signs that a thunder-storm was close at
hand.</p>
<p>It was under the cover of these, that they had heaped the
combustible material against the walls of the cabin, and Ned
had not been able to see what plan they were preparing to
carry out, until they had well-nigh done their work.</p>
<p>One of them he had caught a glimpse of as the last armful
was being carried, and had sent a bullet crashing through his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo; asked Ned in a whisper. &ldquo;They
will fire the straw in a moment now, and the roof of the
cabin, owing to the heat, must be as dry as tinder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be smoked out like a coon in a hollow tree,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
answered the scout. &ldquo;When it comes to that we must go
out and fight hand to hand for our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a fearful odds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it. But we must take them. At least they shall
know that the Death-Dealer is here, and he will not go under
until he has made a half-dozen of them bite the dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have fired the straw,&rdquo; cried Ned. &ldquo;I can smell the
smoke&mdash;and look&mdash;see the light flashing in through the crevices
here. The cursed red-skin would burn up her, whom he
would have for his bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was even as he said. The crackling of the flames outside
could now be heard, and all along the side of the cabin
the light was flashing in through the slight crevices between
the logs. A danger more terrible than any which had before
threatened them was upon them now.</p>
<p>In a minute more the loft was so full of smoke that they
could not stay there.</p>
<p>Feeling their way to the ladder they descended to the
apartment below, where they found their friends also aware of
the new danger that threatened them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerusalem and the Prophets,&rdquo; cried the Yankee. &ldquo;That
pack of mine will be burned up as sure as preaching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No heed was paid to this lament, and Sam Wilson exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The red-skins are trying a new dodge, are they. Do you
think they can make the cabin burn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid so,&rdquo; answered the scout, and then he told
them what they had taken to kindle the flames with.</p>
<p>The roaring of the flames could now be plainly heard as
they leaped up the side of the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it catches upon the roof there is no hope for us,&rdquo; said
the settler, despondingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is there already,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Wilson, who was gazing
up through into the loft. &ldquo;Father in heaven help us, for we
can do nothing of ourselves. Put forth Thy hand and save
us from this terrible fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shout arose from the throats of the savages at that moment;
but as though in answer to her prayer, a loud clap of
thunder resounded above their heads, drowning the shouts of
their enemies. The scout uttered a joyful exclamation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;That sound does my heart good,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;If the
rain will only come down in ten minutes we are saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cabin will be one mass of flames before that time,&rdquo;
cried Ned. &ldquo;The flames have caught upon the roof and it
is blazing like tinder. Pray Heaven that the rain may come
at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; responded all.</p>
<p>The flames roared and surged without, half drowning the
exultant shouts of the savages, who now felt sure of their
victims. The smoke poured into the cabin through every
crevice, until it was all they could do to breathe. Still
though the thunder-peals sounded nearer, the wished-for rain
held aloof, as though on purpose to tantalize them and augment
their fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lie down close to the floor,&rdquo; cried the scout. &ldquo;You can
breathe better there. If it don&rsquo;t rain in three minutes&rsquo; time,
we must trust ourselves to the red devils outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They obeyed his direction, but hardly had they stretched
themselves out before they were startled by an object which
came down from the loft and went bouncing across the
floor.</p>
<p>Before they could make up their minds what it was, another
object came crashing down upon them.</p>
<p>It was the Yankee and his pack.</p>
<p>He had gone up for it, fearful that the fire might consume
it before it fastened upon him.</p>
<p>Come what would he was bound that they should go together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerusalem and the Prophets, I&rsquo;m killed, I know I am.
Plague take the smoke. I missed the top round and down
I come kerwollups.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have nigh about killed me, anyway,&rdquo; exclaimed Sam.
&ldquo;You fell right acrost my back. I hope you&rsquo;ll be able to
take that pack to the other world with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sho! you don&rsquo;t say so. Well, I can&rsquo;t say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>What more he would have said there is no knowing, but
the smoke just then set him into a fit of coughing, so the
rest of it was lost.</p>
<p>It was a terrible moment.</p>
<p>Above and around them the red flames were crackling;
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
their forked tongues eating their way into where they were.
Without, the howling savages were waiting for them to come
forth to meet as terrible a fate.</p>
<p>Nothing could save them but the prayed-for rain from
heaven.</p>
<p>Would it never come?</p>
<p>Were they surely doomed to death?</p>
<p>It would seem so.</p>
<p>At last the scout cried, chokingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the door. We may as well die one way as another.
We can&rsquo;t live longer here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment, when all indeed seemed lost; when there
appeared no other alternative but to throw themselves out
upon the savages, a new sound broke upon their ears.</p>
<p>The floodgates of heaven were at last unloosed, and the
rain was descending in torrents.</p>
<p>Never was rain more welcome to human beings than to
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven be thanked, we are saved!&rdquo; cried Sam Wilson,
joyously. &ldquo;The fire can&rsquo;t stand such a flood as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That it can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; exclaimed the scout. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all right
now and the red-skins are balked ag&rsquo;in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few moments the rain and the flames fought for the
mastery, and then the latter succumbed.</p>
<p>It was no match for its opponent, and in a few minutes
the battle was over.</p>
<p>The settlers were saved from danger by the fire.</p>
<p>Silently they stood grouped together, listening to the warring
of the elements without, and wondering what had become
of the savages.</p>
<p>They had no sign to tell them what they were about.</p>
<p>They did not believe they had given up the errand on
which they had come, and departed.</p>
<p>They all knew the nature of the savages too well to expect
that.</p>
<p>Sam Wilson demanded of Dick what he thought they were
up to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Planning some other deviltry, no doubt. They ain&rsquo;t far
off. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if they had took to the forest for
shelter till the shower is over.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven grant that they may not return again,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Wilson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they will. You can bet on that,&rdquo; answered the
scout. &ldquo;But where does this water come from, Sam? I
didn&rsquo;t know that your cabin leaked like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did not. The fire must have burned the roof away,
and so let it in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rain was pouring down upon them in torrents as
though there was indeed no covering above their heads.</p>
<p>The scout gave a quick start, as this idea of new danger
was forced home to his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the roof is burned away we can&rsquo;t stay here,&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;Stay where you are, and I will try and find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He moved away from them, and they heard him feeling
his way up the ladder.</p>
<p>Not three minutes had passed before he was back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Sam Wilson, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Half of the roof is burnt to a cinder, and part of it has
tumbled in!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words struck to their hearts like ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo; said Ned, almost in a tone of despair.
&ldquo;If this be so, we can&rsquo;t keep the savages out, the moment
they discover how matters stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then my pack will be gone, as sure as preaching,&rdquo;
groaned the Yankee, who had stood with his hand upon it,
ever since he had tumbled down from the loft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;ll be pouring in upon us thicker than the lice
of Egypt. I can&rsquo;t see but one way. We&rsquo;ve got to get out of
this shell as soon as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where can we go? The moment we go out we fall into
the hands of the red-skins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prehaps not. I&rsquo;ve got it into my head that they ain&rsquo;t
hanging round here now. They ain&rsquo;t further off, I&rsquo;ll allow,
than the edge of the forest, but I don&rsquo;t believe that they are
standing out here taking this pelting. At any rate we&rsquo;ve
got to find out, and thar&rsquo;s no time to lose in doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are we to know?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m going out to see</i>,&rdquo; answered the scout, coolly.</p>
<p>An exclamation of surprise broke from the lips of each of
the group.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;You will go to your death if you do,&rdquo; said Sam Wilson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And death will come to all of us if we stay here,&rdquo; said
Dick. &ldquo;If we can get acrost the clearing into the edge of
the woods without the varmints knowing it, our sight will be
enough better than to stay here. I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s a
savage near us, and now is our time. The rain may stop any
moment and then it will be too late. It ain&rsquo;t lightened any
lately, and &rsquo;cording to that the shower is passing off. Keep
quiet here till I come back. If I have good luck I won&rsquo;t be
gone long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned toward the ladder, instead of the door as they
expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you going out?&rdquo; called Ned after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through the roof. There&rsquo;s a hole big enough there to
let out a giant.  If you hear three knocks upon the door you
can open it, and let me in. All will be right then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They held their breath to listen. They heard him for a
moment moving about upon the floor of the loft, and then
the beating of the rain drowned all further sound.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br />OUT INTO THE DARKNESS.</h2>
<p>It was by the sense of feeling alone, that Dick went up
the ladder and moved along the loft with a cautious step.</p>
<p>The darkness was so great that it could almost be felt.</p>
<p>Only here and there above his head, a dull, red light shone
on the charred beams, telling that a trace of the fire still lingered
there.</p>
<p>But the coals were dim, and gave out no light to serve as
a guide to his footsteps.</p>
<p>The rain had well-nigh extinguished them, and if it continued
for a few minutes longer they would go out in deeper
blackness.</p>
<p>Slowly the scout moved along until he came to a spot
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
where the rain came down without hindrance upon his
head.</p>
<p>Feeling with his outstretched hands in the darkness, he
found that the aperture in the roof at this point was
sufficiently large to admit of his passing through without any
difficulty.</p>
<p>Thrice he made the attempt, but each time was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The charred wood was not strong enough to support his
weight, and it gave way, letting him back again.</p>
<p>But the fourth time he got a firmer hold and drew himself
out upon the roof.</p>
<p>The rain seemed to beat down upon him with redoubled
fury, as though it meant to drive him from his perch.</p>
<p>But he did not care for this. His only solicitude was for
fear that the roof between him and the eaves was not strong
enough to hold him, and that he would fall through into the
loft again.</p>
<p>Slowly he moved down over the inclined plane.</p>
<p>It was no easy job to keep his hold good, and at the same
time make sure that the roof was strong enough to bear his
weight.</p>
<p>The rain made it slippery, and had it not been for the action
of the fire upon the timbers of which it was composed,
he could never have kept good his hold there.</p>
<p>But slowly and carefully he went on, and at last drew
close to the eaves.</p>
<p>It was something like ten feet to the earth, but this was
nothing for him to leap down.</p>
<p>On more than one occasion when his life was threatened,
he had leaped more than double that distance.</p>
<p>He was close to the edge of the roof now, and was preparing
himself for the spring.</p>
<p>He tried to peer down into the darkness to see if the coast
was clear of enemies, but the gloom was so dense that he
could not see an arm&rsquo;s length before his face.</p>
<p>At that instant, as luck would have it, a pale flash of
lightning lighted up the scene for a moment.</p>
<p>The scout used his eyes well, and thereby made a discovery.</p>
<p>The ground about the cabin was free from savages, except
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
at one point, where a single one stood wet and forlorn.</p>
<p>Evidently he had been left to watch the cabin while his
comrades sought shelter in the forest until the rain should
be over.</p>
<p>It was a wonder that he caught a glimpse of the savage,
for he was immediately beneath him, and had he sprung
down he must have landed directly upon his head.</p>
<p>The flash was gone in a moment, and then if possible it
was darker than before.</p>
<p>For a minute the scout was undecided what to do.</p>
<p>He could not retreat up again over the roof, the way was
so difficult; and if he could, it would amount to nothing for
him to do so.</p>
<p>There was but one feasible course before him, and that he
decided upon.</p>
<p>It was to leap down upon the head of the unsuspicious savage,
bear him to the earth and slay him before he could utter
a sound of alarm.</p>
<p>Taking his knife from his belt, he placed it between his
teeth, and then fixing his hands firmly upon the eaves he
was ready for the spring.</p>
<p>For only an instant did he hesitate, and then he went
down upon the unsuspicious savage, whose first intimation of
danger was the full force of the descending scout upon his
head and shoulders.</p>
<p>No one taken at such a disadvantage could resist the shock,
and the red-skin went down to the earth as suddenly as
though the cabin itself had fallen upon him.</p>
<p>He tried to utter a cry of alarm, but it died away before
his lips could give it utterance.</p>
<p>The fingers of the Death-Dealer were upon his throat with
a grip like iron, and he could utter no sound.</p>
<p>Another moment, and the scout had his knife in his right
hand, ready to strike a fatal blow.</p>
<p>The savage struggled fiercely, but he was like a child in
the hand of his enemy.</p>
<p>The opportunity the scout sought came soon. The breast
of the savage was exposed, and he drove the knife to the
hilt in his heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Coolly wiping the blade upon the garments of the savage,
Dick rose to his feet and quietly listened.</p>
<p>Not a sound met his ear except the beating of the rain
and the distant rumble of thunder away to the eastward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if thar is any more of the varmints sneaking
round here,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;It looks light up thar to
the westward, and the rain will be over soon I guess. I wish
there would be another bit of a flash, so that I might get another
glimpse of matters round here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly had the thought been expressed, when as though
in answer to his desire, another pale gleam of lightning
lighted up the scene about him.</p>
<p>It was only momentary; but the scout used his eyes well,
and was convinced that there was no savage near except the
one whose corpse lay bleeding beside him. But he knew
that the moment the rain held up a little they would be back
again. From the looks of the sky he felt assured that they
had only a few moments that they could call their own, and
that they must bestir themselves if they hoped to escape.</p>
<p>Hastily he passed round the cabin to make assurance
doubly sure, and then he approached the door and gave the
three low raps upon it; the signal they had agreed upon.</p>
<p>They heard it, for he could hear them removing the barricade
inside, and in a little time he heard the voice of Sam
Wilson demanding as he opened the door a little way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is you, is it not, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is. Open the door. There&rsquo;s no danger jest
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The settler complied, and the scout stepped within and
the door was immediately closed behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the savages gone?&rdquo; demanded Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is, they are now. I didn&rsquo;t find but one of &rsquo;em
there, and I fixed him so that he won&rsquo;t trouble us ag&rsquo;in. I
guess it puzzled him a little to think where I come from
when I landed on his head. But I did not give him a great
while to think about it, afore he had a touch of my knife,
which done for him so far as this world is concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilson and Ruth shuddered. It made their blood
run cold to hear him talk so coolly of what to them, despite
the circumstances seemed almost like murder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you still think that we had better leave the cabin?&rdquo;
said Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. If we stay here a half-hour longer we can&rsquo;t
call our ha&rsquo;r our own. It will be hanging to the belt of
some of the red-skins. Get ready as soon as ye can. Don&rsquo;t
take any thing to weigh ye down for we shall have all we
can do to get away with our lives I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall take my pack,&rdquo; cried the Yankee. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
think I&rsquo;ll leave that behind, do ye? I had rather leave my
ha&rsquo;r than that. I might get money enough to buy a wig,
but I could never get a new pack ag&rsquo;in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it if you want to,&rdquo; growled Dick; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll bet a
dollar that the red-skins will have the ransacking of it afore
you&rsquo;re out of this scrape. I believe you think more of that
bundle than you do of any thing else in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; chuckled the Yankee. &ldquo;I do
think a master sight of it. Nigh about as much as I should
of a wife if I had one. But I&rsquo;ll be deuced if I ain&rsquo;t afraid
that the rain will spile every thing there is in it. Say, mister,
hadn&rsquo;t we better wait &rsquo;till it holds up a little?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you hold that tongue of your&rsquo;n?&rdquo; cried the scout,
angrily. &ldquo;I never saw such a thing to wag in my life.
Stay behind if you want to, and make a dicker with the red-skins
if you can. Pass me Susannah, Ned, I believe it was
you that took her when I went up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Susannah?&rdquo; inquired the Yankee. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
know that there was any lady here by that name. Oh! it&rsquo;s
yer rifle, is it? I swan, I never heard a gun called by that
name afore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each in obedience to the scout&rsquo;s commands prepared to
leave the cabin.</p>
<p>Hastily Mrs. Wilson and Ruth donned their outer garments
so that in a measure they might be protected from the rain.</p>
<p>They could take nothing with them. All they possessed
they must leave behind to the savages.</p>
<p>But they gave no thought to this. Could their lives but
be spared they would be content.</p>
<p>A few moments sufficed to make them ready for their
flight, and then the scout laid his hand upon the door and
opened it a little way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, quickly. &ldquo;The clouds are breaking and
the rain will be over in a minute. We haven&rsquo;t got a moment&rsquo;s
time to spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped out into the darkness, followed by Ned, who
held the hand of Ruth in his own. Mrs. Wilson came next,
and after her the Yankee with his pack upon his back. The
settler came last, closing the door of his home behind
him with a sad heart. It was not likely, he thought, that he
would ever set foot over its threshold again. Once in the
hands of the savages they would not leave it until it was a
mass of blackened embers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fasten it if you can in some way,&rdquo; said the scout, in a
whisper. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want them to know that we are gone, if
they get here within the next ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no way to do this upon the outside, the settler
said. The scout hesitated for an instant. If he had felt
sure of the time, he would have gone within, made it fast,
and come out by way of the roof as he had done before.
But he dared not do it, so he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter, let it go. Perhaps they won&rsquo;t think to try
the door as soon as they get back. Follow me close and
don&rsquo;t speak above a whisper. We don&rsquo;t know how near we
may come to the red-skins in crossing the clearing. There&rsquo;s
a chance that we may run full into &rsquo;em. But we won&rsquo;t take
that so long as there is another. Come on, I&rsquo;m afeard of
them clouds up yonder where the moon is. If they break
away and it comes out bright and clear afore we get to the
edge of the woods it will be bad for us. If the red-skins get
their eye upon us our chances will be slim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the shortest distance to the woods upon the south,
but the scout did not start off in that direction. He thought,
and wisely, that the savages would have fled to the nearest
point for shelter when the rain drove them from the cabin.
Therefore he bent his steps in the opposite direction, while
the other fugitives followed close at his heels, hoping that
the cover of the forest might be gained in safety before the
moon by breaking forth should reveal them to their enemies.</p>
<p>Eagerly they pressed forward as fast as they were able.
Despite the symptoms the moon gave of breaking through the
clouds, it was still intensely dark. The way was rough, in
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
some places over fallen trees, and here they found it impossible
to make the time they hoped to do. Hardly a word
passed between them, and when they did open their lips the
words they uttered were hardly above their breath. Each
felt how much depended upon secrecy and expedition, and
therefore they used every caution which was in their power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Courage,&rdquo; whispered the scout. &ldquo;In three minutes more
we shall be safe. I can see the dark line of the woods now,
right ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly had the words left his lips before through a rift in
the dark clouds a flood of moonlight passed down, revealing
the clearing and all it contained almost as plainly as the sunlight
would have done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! for your lives!&rdquo; exclaimed the scout, as he broke
into a run; but before either of them had gained the shelter
of the forest, a fierce war-whoop behind them told that they
were discovered.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br />THE MIDNIGHT AMBUSH.</h2>
<p>A cry of terror and despair broke from the lips of Ruth
and her mother, as the shout of the savages fell like a knell
of death upon their ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! keep quiet as you hope for your lives,&rdquo; cried the
scout, in a thrilling tone. &ldquo;It may be that they ain&rsquo;t seen
us arter all. Who knows but what they g&rsquo;in that shout when
they got back to the cabin? We had ought to thank our
stars that we ain&rsquo;t back there now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick looked backward as he said this, hoping that the
words he uttered might be true, though he felt sure that they
need not hope for any such good luck. That glance showed
him how frail his hopes were. Between them and the cabin
he could see nearly a score of human forms coming swiftly
in their direction. As ill-fortune would have it, the moon
had shone out a few moments too soon, and an evil chance
had revealed them to the savages at that selfsame moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>But, the moonlight did not linger long over the clearing.
As if content with the mischief it had done, it hid its face
again behind the clouds and a deeper gloom than before took
its place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Courage,&rdquo; cried Dick, urging them onward. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
got to have sharp eyes if they can find us in the forest afore
daylight comes. Strike off here to the left a little. We can
fool them now if the moon don&rsquo;t come out ag&rsquo;in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darn it all, I wish I was to hum,&rdquo; muttered the Yankee.
&ldquo;If I was only up in New Hampshire I&rsquo;d give a dollar. I
sw&rsquo;ar I would now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The movement of the clouds over the face of the moon
favored them, and they were well in the shelter of the forest
before it showed itself again.</p>
<p>It was so dark here that they could hardly see their hand
before their face; but the scout did not allow them to pause
for an instant, though they almost had to feel their way
along. Yet though they made the best time they could, their
pace was slow, for they had as it were to feel their way along.
Haste would only expose them to more danger, for they
would be liable to make some sound which would betray
them. The snapping of a twig might convey to the savages
the knowledge of their whereabouts, and expose them to capture
or instant death.</p>
<p>For some twenty minutes after they had gained the shelter
of the forest, they kept on in this way, and then, in a low
tone, the scout bade them pause.</p>
<p>Each stood motionless in their tracks, their ears strained to
the utmost to catch the faintest sound of their pursuers.</p>
<p>A silence as profound as that of the grave was around
them. The forest seemed to be holding its breath in expectancy.</p>
<p>The savages, if they were following them close, were doing
so with noiseless feet, for not the slightest sound could
they catch on either side.</p>
<p>After a silence the scout spoke again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all right now for an hour or two,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Unless
they stumble over us, they can&rsquo;t find us more than they
can a weasel in a wall. Should the moon come out bright
they may strike our trail and follow it, but I hardly think
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
they can. But they will do their best as soon as the sun
comes up. But by that time we must be a long way from
here toward the settlement. Rushing Water thought he was
sure of the gal when he see us, but he&rsquo;ll find out afore
he&rsquo;s through that a bird in the hand is worth two in the
bush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what old Sal Fisher used to say up in New Hampshire,&rdquo;
said Peleg. &ldquo;She&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>What it was she said the company did not learn, for the
scout broke in with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep that tongue of your&rsquo;n still, will ye? It&rsquo;s wuss than
a clapper to a bell; and I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it brought the
hull tribe of savages down upon ye. Follow me ag&rsquo;in, and
don&rsquo;t one of ye speak above a whisper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Yankee muttered something in so low a tone that none
of the rest of them understood what it was; and they all
moved forward in the wake of the scout, who notwithstanding
the darkness seemed familiar with every step of the way,
far more so than did the settlers who for years had lived so
close to where they were.</p>
<p>The hand of Ruth was yet in that of her lover, and though
it still trembled with fear, the words which he ever and anon
whispered in her ear, went far to reassure her and to give
her courage.</p>
<p>Sam Wilson walked by the side of his wife, and behind
them bringing up the rear came Peleg Parker with his pack
upon his back.</p>
<p>And so for an hour they went on, plunging deeper and
deeper into the forest, and leaving as they fondly hoped their
enemies behind them.</p>
<p>Were they unable to find their trail before daylight, they
were in hopes to be so far on their way toward the nearest
settlement, that they would have no trouble in making their
escape.</p>
<p>Now and then the moon would break through the clouds,
deluging the forest with a flood of silver light, and then it
would hide its face again leaving the night blacker than it
was before.</p>
<p>The scout knew well that a savage, even, could not follow
a trail under these circumstances, and with every minute
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
they remained unmolested his spirits rose and he felt more
sanguine of their escape.</p>
<p>Nearly an hour had passed, and they had kept steadily on
their way; when suddenly the scout who had glanced behind
them, as the moon broke forth brilliantly, bade them
pause in their tracks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? Did you see any thing?&rdquo; demanded Ned
Tapley, in a low tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hist! the red-skins are close behind us!</i>&rdquo; he answered, in a
low voice.</p>
<p>A thrill of alarm and fear struck to the heart of each at
these words.</p>
<p>After all their hopes of escape, were they doomed to destruction?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure it was savages you saw?&rdquo; asked Sam Wilson,
in a whisper, as he cast a glance backward over the
way they had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. There is one if not more upon our track. I saw
him dart behind a tree as plainly as I can see you now.
Most like there are others along with him though I did not
see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Circumvent the varmints if we can. I know some of
their tricks, and I&rsquo;m going to play &rsquo;em off on them. The
moon will be under a cloud ag&rsquo;in in a minute and then I&rsquo;ll
see what can be done. Till then let&rsquo;s keep on as we&rsquo;ve been
going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went on for perhaps a dozen rods, and then the forest
was buried in darkness again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now is our time,&rdquo; exclaimed the scout. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let these
red-skins know that Dick, the Death-Dealer, is on their track
yet. He&rsquo;s sent a great many of &rsquo;em under, and he ain&rsquo;t got
through with the business yet. You, Sam, go slowly on with
the wimmen, and Ned you come with me. You are a good
shot and it may be that I shall have need of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want me, I expect,&rdquo; said Peleg. &ldquo;I never
was very good at fighting, and besides I&rsquo;ve got this ere pack
to see to. If the red-skins get hold on it, I&rsquo;m ruined etarnelly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want you,&rdquo; answered Dick. &ldquo;Stay where
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
you are, and try to keep that tongue of yours still. Mind
your rifle, Ned, and come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man gave the hand of Ruth a warm pressure,
and whispered a word of assurance in her ear. Then he allowed
her to pass on, while he came and stood by the side
of the scout, who did not stir out of his tracks until the
others had moved on some dozen yards or more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; he asked, in a low tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find out how many red-skins there is behind us, and
shoot &rsquo;em all if we can. You see that big tree yonder. Well,
get behind it, and shoot the first red-skin that shows himself.
I&rsquo;ll &rsquo;tend to the next one, that comes to hand. We&rsquo;ve got to
fight &rsquo;em here, or the gal is Rushing Water&rsquo;s, and we lose
our scalps in the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; answered Ned. &ldquo;I had rather die a dozen
deaths and see her a corpse, than she should fall into the
hands of the red-skins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it a bit, youngster. But between you and
I, I&rsquo;m afeard our chances are mighty slim. This is a ticklish
scrape we&rsquo;re in, and if we all get out of it and save our
ha&rsquo;r, we shall do well. But let&rsquo;s take our places and see
who comes along. If the red-skins have kept on track of
us, they&rsquo;ll show themselves in a minute or two. Mind that
you don&rsquo;t waste a bullet, for ev&rsquo;ry shot is going to tell in this
scrape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned moved to the spot the scout had assigned him, and
took up his position behind the trunk of the tree. Dick at
once took a similar position, and motionless they waited for
the coming of their enemies.</p>
<p>One, two, five minutes passed, and there was no sign of their
coming.</p>
<p>Could it be that the scout had been mistaken? Though
it was dark it was impossible that they should pass them
without making their presence known.</p>
<p>Two minutes more passed and then a flood of moonlight
poured down upon the spot.</p>
<p>So sudden did it come, that for a moment it almost blinded
the eyes of Ned, with its brilliancy. But they became
used to it in a moment, and glancing back along the way
they had come, he saw a savage within two rods of him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>He was moving slowly forward, half-bent to the earth,
seeking for their trail.</p>
<p>A better chance for a shot a man never had; and remembering
the injunction of the scout, he raised his rifle and took
deliberate aim upon the savage.</p>
<p>The next instant he pulled the trigger, and the sharp report
of his rifle startled the echoes of the forest while the
bullet sped on its deadly work.</p>
<p>It did it well, for the savage gave a leap into the air, and
then fell forward to the earth, where he lay as motionless as
a log.</p>
<p>Another instant, and a second report mingled its echoes
with that of the first.</p>
<p>The eyes of the scout had singled out another enemy, and
another bullet had sped forth on its deadly mission.</p>
<p>But an exclamation of chagrin fell from his lips a moment
after.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ve missed him. What&rsquo;s the matter with you,
Susannah? But like&rsquo;s not the fault&rsquo;s in me. He was some
ways off and the moonbeams danced so that I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t over
sure of my aim. But I&rsquo;ll have him yet. It won&rsquo;t do to let
him bring the rest of &rsquo;em here. Keep on arter the rest of &rsquo;em,
youngster. I&rsquo;ll be back in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hastily reloading his rifle he sprung in the direction of
the spot where he had seen the savage, leaving Ned standing
in his tracks putting another charge into his rifle.</p>
<p>When he neared the spot where the savage had stood, he
found that it was untenanted.</p>
<p>But a glance upon the earth told him that his shot had not
been so poor a one as he had thought.</p>
<p>The leaves were covered with blood, telling that he had
wounded him.</p>
<p>As he saw this he felt better in his mind.</p>
<p>It was seldom he missed an object he took aim upon, and
he was fearful he was losing his art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He bleeds like a stuck bison,&rdquo; he muttered, to himself.
&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t have gone a great ways. I&rsquo;ll make sure of him
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bloody trail led away from the spot, and along this he
hurried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>For some twenty rods he had no difficulty in keeping it,
and then the moon went under a cloud and he was at fault.</p>
<p>Impatiently he stood still, waiting for it to show its face
again.</p>
<p>Five, ten minutes passed, and it gave no symptoms of doing
so.</p>
<p>He began to grow impatient, and to think if he had not
better turn back and rejoin his friends, and hurry them onward
as fast as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him go,&rdquo; he muttered, to himself. &ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s
done for, so he won&rsquo;t trouble us again. But I would like to
have made sure of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave one more glance up to the clouded sky, and then
along the way the wounded savage had gone. Then he
turned upon his heel and set his face once more in the direction
of the spot where he had left the fugitives.</p>
<p>But he had not taken ten steps in that direction before he
gave a sudden start and then stood as though rooted to the
spot.</p>
<p>As well he might, in the alarm and surprise he felt.</p>
<p>A fierce war-whoop, breaking as from a score of throats,
resounded through the arches of the forest.</p>
<p>It came from the direction of the very spot where he supposed
his friends must now be.</p>
<p>The next moment he had sufficient proof that in this he
was not mistaken.</p>
<p>A wild cry of terror and alarm, followed the shout of the
savages, and then the report of a rifle, and soon after, that of
a pistol.</p>
<p>The cry came from the lips of Mrs. Wilson and Ruth, and
the shots must be fired by the settler and the Yankee.</p>
<p>The main body of the red-skins must have passed on before
so noiselessly that they had not been observed, and these
had lain in wait for the fugitives, who, all unsuspicious of
danger in that direction, had walked directly into the ambush
thus prepared for them.</p>
<p>For only a moment did the scout stand riveted to the earth,
as though turned to stone by the knowledge of the fearful
danger his friends were in.</p>
<p>The next, he had shot forward as straight as an arrow
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
from a bow, directly for the spot from whence the tumult
arose.</p>
<p>He heard the report of another rifle, which he doubted not
was that of Ned, and then two or three in quick succession,
which he thought must doubtless be in the hands of some of
the savages.</p>
<p>The tumult continued until he was almost to the spot from
whence it came, and then it suddenly ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could this mean?&rdquo; he asked of himself, as he came
to a sudden halt.</p>
<p>Could it be that the red-skins had slain them all thus
quickly?</p>
<p>A fear took hold upon his heart that this was so.</p>
<p>A moment more and his fear was confirmed. Another war-whoop
rung out, and went echoing away through the forest-aisles.</p>
<p>It was a shout of triumph.</p>
<p>There was no mistaking that.</p>
<p>It told the scout so, plainer than words could have done.</p>
<p>His worst fears were realized.</p>
<p>All the trouble and fatigue they had undergone that night
had been for naught. Their bright hopes of escape were at
an end.</p>
<p>Rushing Water had secured the prize he coveted, and a
worse fate than that of death was in store for Ruth.</p>
<p>Still, it might be death after all, for had not the Indian
girl made a league with the Wizard to accomplish that
end?</p>
<p>All these thoughts ran quickly through his mind as he stood
there uncertain what to do.</p>
<p>In times gone by he had accomplished much with fearful
odds against him; but what could his unaided arm do now
against so many?</p>
<p>Perhaps all his friends but Ruth had fallen; but if they
had, he would not abandon her. So long as she lived he
would work for her deliverance.</p>
<p>But he would not take that shout of triumph as evidence
that all was lost.</p>
<p>Something might be done yet, and he would see with his
own eyes how matters stood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>So he passed slowly onward, keeping a sharp look-out for
the enemy.</p>
<p>The moon and clouds favored him, for no ray of light shot
down into the forest.</p>
<p>Noiselessly and with the utmost caution he crept onward,
until at last he was close to the spot from whence the various
sounds had come.</p>
<p>At that moment the moon broke forth from behind the
clouds with a splendor almost like that of the sun.</p>
<p>Hardly a dozen yards before him, he beheld a number of
figures clustered together.</p>
<p>By sight he could not tell whether they were all savages
or not; but he heard the voice of a woman weeping as though
in the depths of despair. But he was not destined to gaze
long upon the scene! Hardly had he taken it in, when an
arrow, whizzing close to his head, told him that he was discovered.</p>
<p>He gave one of the savages the contents of his rifle, and
then turned and fled, muttering, as he did so:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave ye now; but the Death-Dealer ain&rsquo;t done with
ye yet. He&rsquo;ll ye pay dearly for this night&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br />THE MAIDEN&rsquo;S DOOM.</h2>
<p>We will now go back for a few minutes, and note how it
was that Ruth and her friends fell into the clutches of the
savages.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that the scout told them to move
slowly onward in the direction they were going; while he
and Ned Tapley attended to the savages whom he had seen
hanging in their rear.</p>
<p>These orders they had obeyed, keeping a sharp look-out
about them for danger, until the moment when they had been
startled by the shots fired by their friends behind them.</p>
<p>Ruth, in spite of herself, uttered a cry of terror at the
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
sound, fearful that one of the reports might announce the
death of her lover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; exclaimed her father, warningly. &ldquo;Be calm,
Ruth. You know that Dick warned us not to speak above
our breath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were passing now through a little thicket of evergreens,
whose branches were so thick above their heads that
the rays of moonlight could not penetrate to the earth.</p>
<p>It was as good a place as the savages could have selected
for an ambush; but that there was really danger there, not
one of them suspected.</p>
<p>That, they were looking for in their rear, where the rifle-shots
told them that their friends had already encountered
it.</p>
<p>Suddenly the settler, who was leading the way, recoiled
as though he had received a blow.</p>
<p>As if by magic, a savage sprung up before him, directly in
his path.</p>
<p>The next instant a cry of fear broke from the lips of his
wife and daughter.</p>
<p>On either side the forms of a half-dozen savages sprung
up so close to them that they could almost have touched them
by reaching out their hands.</p>
<p>Unmindful of the hopelessness of their situation, the settler
raised his rifle and discharged it at the breast of the savage
before him.</p>
<p>But the bullet went wide of its mark, for as he pulled the
trigger, a savage upon his right caught hold upon it, and attempted
to wrest it from his grasp.</p>
<p>But this he did not succeed in doing, and pulling it from
the clutches of the savage, the settler brought it down with
such force upon his head as to stretch him senseless upon the
earth.</p>
<p>Another savage had sprung upon Peleg Parker, and with
one hand had grasped his pack on his back, while the other
he entwined in his long hair, and attempted to pull him to
the earth.</p>
<p>But the Yankee had no notion of parting with the former,
even if he lost his hair, and drawing a pistol he endeavored
to shoot down his opponent. But by some mischance it exploded,
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
before he had taken aim, and throwing it to the
earth he had recourse to his fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take that, you thieving varmint!&rdquo; he cried, as he
dealt him a blow between the eyes, that would have felled
an ox; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll l&rsquo;arn ye how to hanker arter other people&rsquo;s
property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The savage went down like a log, but he had so good a
hold in the hair of the Yankee that he took him along with
him, and they both rolled upon the earth together.</p>
<p>Peleg struggled hard to rise; but before he could do so
another savage was firmly planted upon his breast.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Sam Wilson had been assaulted by three or
four of the enemy and was at last borne to the earth; and
one of them, catching him by the hair, circled his scalping-knife
above his head as though he would rob his victim of
his scalp, even before he took his life.</p>
<p>But, with a cry for mercy, Ruth threw herself beside the
savage, and implored him not to do the fatal deed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my life, if you will,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;but spare my father.
He has never harmed a red-man, and do not have his
blood upon your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Rushing Water himself to whom she appealed,
though she did not recognize him in the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will the white maiden give if no harm shall
be done to her friends?&rdquo; he said, in a low tone.</p>
<p>Ruth felt a ray of hope steal into her heart at these
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any thing she has,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;If Rushing Water
has not a heart of stone, let no harm be done to any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The will of the white maiden is law to Rushing Water.
The lives of her kindred shall be spared as she asks. But let
her remember the promise she has made. The chief will
claim it soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke a word of command, and coming at that moment
it saved the life of at least one of them. An instant
later, and the Yankee would have had no further use for his
pack in this world. An arm was even at that moment raised
to take his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not save me by any such promise as you have made,&rdquo;
cried her father. &ldquo;Think what it is that the chief will require
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
of you. There is but one thing he desires, and that is
to take you to his lodge. Let us rather die where we are, than
this fate should be yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth felt her heart sink like lead in her bosom. But her
promise had been given and she would not revoke it. Of
what use would it be for her to do so. She was completely
in his power, and he would do with her as he chose, even
though she stood out against him. Now she had his promise
that the lives of her friends should be spared, and that
was more than she had hoped for.</p>
<p>At this moment there was the report of another rifle, and
a bullet whistled above their heads.</p>
<p>Our friends knew well it came from Ned&rsquo;s rifle, and that
he was rushing upon his own destruction.</p>
<p>But there was no help for it. Even before they had a
chance to think, he had dashed wildly in among them, dealing
blows right and left with the breech of his rifle.</p>
<p>But his career was of short duration. Valiant as he was,
he could not successfully contend against such fearful odds,
and in less time than it takes to tell it, he was thrown to the
earth, where his limbs were secured in such a manner that
he was entirely powerless.</p>
<p>His life would have been taken in an instant, had it not
been for the promise the chief had given to Ruth, and who
eagerly reminded him of it when she saw the fearful danger
her lover was in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God, Ruth, you are alive,&rdquo; cried the young man,
as he hopelessly wrestled with his captors. &ldquo;I was fearful
that you all had perished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are unharmed, Ned. The chief has promised
that for the present, at least, our lives shall be spared.
Therefore, make no more resistance as it will only be worse
for us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam Wilson heaved a groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she throws herself away, Ned, to save us. Better
by far that we never move from this spot. Oh! that I should
have ever lived to see this hour when my child sells herself
to save the lives of her friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned Tapley started up, and strained at the bonds that fettered
his limbs with all his strength.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Ruth, what is it that
you have promised?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the white maiden be still. Rushing Water will answer
the pale-face&rsquo;s words. She is to be the bride of the
chief. When the Indian village is gained, she will go to his
lodge. Let her pale-face friends keep as silent as the dead
if they would live. If they do not, the chief may forget his
promise and slay them now. The white maiden will be his
all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our friends knew by the tone in which these words were
uttered, that the chief meant what he said, and that he would
not hesitate a moment to carry out his threats. Therefore,
they thought silence on their part was the best thing for them
now. It was hard for the settler, or Ned, to contain themselves,
yet they saw that they must if they would save their
own lives. Something might turn up before the Indian village
was reached which would help them to make their escape.
As yet the scout was free, and they hoped he would
remain so; for it might be that he could achieve their deliverance.
If man could do it, they knew he would.</p>
<p>Each silently prayed that he might make good his escape,
instead of coming to their assistance now. He could do no
good at present, and should he fall into their hands his
doom was sealed at once. No power on earth could prevent
their taking summary vengeance upon him. The Death-Dealer
had sent too many of their braves to the spirit-land, for them
to spare him, should they once get him into their clutches.</p>
<p>The work of securing their captives had hardly been completed,
when one of them caught a glimpse of the scout surveying
the scene before him.</p>
<p>His form was too well known to them; too strange and uncouth
to be mistaken, and a flight of arrows was at once sent in
his direction, while they bounded forward toward the spot
where he stood. A parting shot from him, which made one
of them bite the dust, was what they received in return, and
then he fled away, while they followed on for awhile, in
what they knew, from past experiences, would be hopeless
pursuit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile those that remained behind carefully secured
those of their prisoners that as yet had remained unbound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Peleg Parker submitted to his bonds with very ill grace.
With his hands bound tightly behind him he felt that he
had not so good a hold upon his pack as he could have
desired.</p>
<p>In fact now it was at the mercy of the savages whenever
they saw fit to explore its mysteries.</p>
<p>That they would find an opportunity to do so sooner than
he liked he had no doubt.</p>
<p>He had first tried to coax and then to hire the savages not
to bind him.</p>
<p>He was magnanimous enough to offer them two dollars
&ldquo;and the darndest best chance to trade they ever had in their
lives&rdquo; to let him go, but it had no effect upon their hardened
natures.</p>
<p>They kept at their work as unconcernedly as though he
had not been talking to them as fast as his tongue could run.</p>
<p>At first it had been in a low tone, but as he found he
made no impression upon them, he kept raising his voice,
until at last it became a whining sort of a howl.</p>
<p>At last Rushing Water thought it was about time for him
to stop, and striding up to where he lay he shook his knife
threateningly at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let not the pale-face whine like a licked cur,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;If the chief hears more, the coward shall have a knife in
his heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peleg thought it best to keep quiet, though he was half
tempted to ask him how he would trade the knife he held in
his hand for one that he carried in his pack. But the moonlight
was shining upon the face of the savage and he saw a
look in his eye which told him that it would require but little
to make him put his threat into execution.</p>
<p>None of them had been spared the bonds. Even Mrs.
Wilson and Ruth were secured the same as their male friends,
though perhaps their bonds were a little softer and not drawn
quite so tightly. Evidently Rushing Water did not mean
that any of his captives should escape him through any fault
of his.</p>
<p>In less than half an hour, those who had gone in pursuit
of the scout, returned. As their chief expected they came
empty-handed. None of them were fleet enough to overtake
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
the Death-Dealer. They had tried that game with him before
and had always failed. There was not a savage on the
river who could keep pace with him when he done his best.</p>
<p>It was now near daylight. A little longer and the short
summer night would be gone and the East would grow gray
with the coming morn.</p>
<p>The night had been one of toil and excitement to both
parties and they felt the need of rest. But Rushing Water
decided that they could not have it here. No time should
be lost in getting away from the neighborhood of the settlements,
where danger might be apprehended should the whites
get a clue to what had been going on that night. Once at
the Indian village in the stronghold of his tribe he would
defy any force that might be sent against him.</p>
<p>Therefore he gave orders for them to start at once, and
closely surrounding their prisoners so that there might be no
loophole of escape, they set forth upon the long, wearisome
way that lay before them.</p>
<p>Rushing Water walked by the side of Ruth and her mother.
He did not mean to leave sight of her who had cost him so
much trouble.</p>
<p>To the great delight of Peleg, he was made to carry his
own pack. One of the savages tried it but found it too heavy
for his comfort. But the Yankee would have borne double
its weight rather than to have been separated from it.</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br />THE TRAIL DIVIDED.</h2>
<p>Leaving the savages to conduct their captives along the
toilsome way that led to the Indian village, let us return, and
for a time follow the movements of the scout.</p>
<p>Turning his back upon the spot where misfortune had overtaken
his friends, he struck off at a round pace through the
forest, with the red-skins following at his heels.</p>
<p>He had little doubt but that he would be able to distance
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
them in the race, though he was by no means so fresh as he
might have been.</p>
<p>Since morn of the previous day, no food had passed his
lips, and as the reader is aware he had undergone a great
deal of fatigue.</p>
<p>Still he did not doubt but what he could easily leave the
savages behind him.</p>
<p>And this he did. Before twenty minutes had passed he
had left them so far in the rear, that he could hear nothing
of them, though he paused and listened several times for the
sound of their footsteps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t got the Death-Dealer into yer clutches yet,&rdquo;
he muttered to himself. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to live to stop a good
deal more of yer deviltry. You&rsquo;ve done pretty well to-night,
but you ain&rsquo;t out of the woods yet. You&rsquo;ve got a good deal
of trouble still, afore you settle down to housekeeping, Mister
Red-skin. I don&rsquo;t know but what I am mistaken, but I
think I shall have a hand in settling your hash myself. I&rsquo;ve
only turned my back on ye for a little while. I shall be in
yer company ag&rsquo;in full as soon as you&rsquo;ll want me I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus communing with himself he went on slowly, stopping
every now and then to hearken for his pursuers. But
there was no sign of them now.</p>
<p>Evidently they had given over the race, and returned to
the spot from whence they started.</p>
<p>Though assured of this the scout went on still further.
He went on aimlessly. He was bound for no particular
place. He only wanted to get so far from the savages that
there would be no danger of their coming up with him, while
he stopped and refreshed himself. Though he had been up
thus much of the night he did not feel the want of sleep, for
he had got enough of that the day before. But he did begin
to feel a little hungry, and this demand of his appetite
he determined to gratify as soon as he should be at what he
considered a safe distance from his enemies.</p>
<p>With this object in view, he went on for more than a mile
from the spot where he had seen the last savage. By this
time daylight was breaking, and he felt safe in setting about
the work he had in hand. Keeping his eyes about him, he
soon caught sight of a noble deer, attempting to flee away
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
before him. Raising his rifle he brought it down before it
had taken a dozen leaps; and then reloading his piece, he
approached the spot where it had fallen.</p>
<p>To set a fire brightly burning, and to flay the deer, were
but the work of a few minutes with him; and in a little
while he had a huge slice of it roasting over the coals, the smell
of which would have been grateful to any man even if he
had not broken his fast for the last twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>All the while he kept a sharp look-out about him for danger.
He did not know but the report of his rifle might attract
the savages toward the spot, though he felt very sure
that those in pursuit of him had long since turned back.
But there might be others prowling around in that section,
who might seek to find out who it was that had fired the
shot.</p>
<p>But no one came to disturb him while he ate his fill of the
venison; and when his hunger was satisfied he cut other
large slices from the deer, which he proceeded to roast in the
same manner he had the other. When he had quite a quantity
prepared in this way he made it into a compact parcel,
and bestowed it about him, so that he would have something
by him to appease his hunger, should he be placed in such a
way that it would be next to impossible for him to procure
it as he had now done.</p>
<p>It seemed too bad to leave the remainder of the deer there
for the wild beasts to feast upon, but there was no help for
it. So he consoled himself with the thought, that there were
plenty more of its like in the forest, so that none need suffer
for the needless waste he had made, and then bethought
himself of what was next to be done.</p>
<p>For a little time he hesitated which of two courses to pursue,
in the work he had laid out for himself.</p>
<p>It was no slight task as he knew to wrest the captives out
of the clutches of Rushing Water, with none but his own
arm to aid him.</p>
<p>Yet this he was firmly determined to do.</p>
<p>Many were the conflicts he had had with the red-skins,
and as yet he had always come out victorious in the end.</p>
<p>He knew very well that Rushing Water would set out at
once for the dwelling-place of his tribe, and he hardly
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
thought that he would pause until he got there, so anxious
would he be to place Ruth where there could be no
possibility of her escaping him.</p>
<p>He knew, also, that he must rescue her between now and
the time she should reach there, if he did so at all.</p>
<p>Once there and a new danger would threaten her.</p>
<p>The Indian girl, in her jealous rage, would soon find some
way to administer to her the deadly potion the Wizard had
promised to prepare for her.</p>
<p>He knew well the way to the Indian village, and the
point he was now trying to decide in his mind was this:</p>
<p>Should he hurry on before them for a considerable distance,
and lay in wait for their coming? or, had he better
now take the trail and follow on behind them, watching for
the opportunity he sought?</p>
<p>The latter they might mistrust he would do, and so some
of the red-skins lay in ambush for him.</p>
<p>For some time he revolved this question in his mind, and
then decided upon the latter course.</p>
<p>He thought this the best way to accomplish his purpose,
and he would keep his eyes open for danger.</p>
<p>He knew that they stood in fear of the Death-Dealer, and
that they would give him a wide berth, unless by their numbers
they hoped to match his cunning and the strength of his
arm.</p>
<p>His course decided upon, he leisurely took his way back
in the direction he had come.</p>
<p>He was in no hurry to reach the spot of the recent conflict,
for he knew that even though they had three or four
hours the start of him, he could easily come up with them
before nightfall, until which hour he knew that nothing
could be done.</p>
<p>So he went on at a slow pace, and the sun was nearly three
hours high in the heavens, when he arrived at last at the
spot where he had last seen his friends in the hands of the
red-skins.</p>
<p>He did not expect to find a living soul there, and in this
he was not mistaken.</p>
<p>The spot was as silent as the grave.</p>
<p>But he had had his fears that he might find the mangled
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
remains of some of his friends lying there, but to his joy he
found that this was not the case.</p>
<p>All of them had been spared for a short time at least.</p>
<p>A trail as plainly perceivable as the sun in the heavens,
led away from the spot, and he lost but little time in setting
off upon it.</p>
<p>From the appearance of the ground he had made up his
mind that they had not tarried long on the spot after they
had secured their captives, and therefore they had several hours
the start of him.</p>
<p>But this did not disturb him any. He knew they could
not hurry the women along very fast, so it would be an easy
task for him to overtake them by the time he desired to do so.</p>
<p>So he struck out upon the trail at his usual gait, feeling
sure that by the time the sun went down he would have come
up with them.</p>
<p>He had no difficulty in keeping the trail. It lay broad and
plain before him. The red-skins had made no effort to conceal
it. Perhaps they thought they could not hide it from
him if they tried to do so; and then they may have thought
that there would be little likelihood of his attempting to
follow them. He had fled away before them, and they
could hardly think that he would have the hardihood to return
and contend with the odds against him.</p>
<p>Only once during the day did he pause for a little rest.
On the bank of a small stream he sat down when the sun
was at its meridian and partook of a portion of the food he
had prepared that morning. As yet he had found no sign
where the savages had paused for rest or refreshment, and
he knew that the captives must be well-nigh worn out for
want of both.</p>
<p>The sun was hardly more than two hours high when suddenly
the scout paused, and looked about him with a puzzled
look. The trail parted here.</p>
<p>This was something that he had not counted on. What
reasons could the savages have had for parting? Could it
be that fearing pursuit from him, they had done so for the
purpose of misleading him?</p>
<p>Or did Rushing Water wish to separate Ruth from her
friends?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>The scout was puzzled to decide which, but so long as it
was done it did not matter so much why.</p>
<p>Carefully he examined the ground for a short distance
along either of the branches of the trail, and at last he was
able to determine how the prisoners had been divided between
them.</p>
<p>The largest body had taken along with them all save one.</p>
<p>This the footprints showed to be a woman; and was either
Ruth or her mother.</p>
<p>He at once decided that it was the former.</p>
<p>A sudden suspicion occurred to his mind.</p>
<p>Had not Rushing Water separated them for some fell purpose
of his own?</p>
<p>Though he did not know it, yet he felt sure that Ruth
had purchased their lives, by some promise she had made the
savage.</p>
<p>Had she not done so, they would most assuredly have
slain them all, as soon as they had them in their power.</p>
<p>That this was the intention of the chief, he knew from
what he had heard the Indian girl confess to the Wizard.</p>
<p>Now, instead of taking them to the village, he had separated
them from Ruth, but for what purpose?</p>
<p>He had a strong presentiment that they were led away for
sacrifice.</p>
<p>The more he thought on the subject the more convinced
he was that he was right, and the stronger were the fears he
felt for their safety.</p>
<p>For a few minutes he hesitated, unable in his mind to decide
what course to pursue.</p>
<p>He wished to follow on, and try and rescue Ruth before
she should reach the Indian village; but if he did this he
must abandon the others to their fate.</p>
<p>He knew that she was not in immediate danger, while
the others might even now be falling beneath the blows of
the savages.</p>
<p>He hesitated no longer.</p>
<p>It was his duty to try and succor those in the most imminent
danger, first.</p>
<p>After all it might prove that he was mistaken, but it was
impressed upon him that he had decided right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>With one more glance at the trail plainly marked by the
footprints of Ruth, he took the other, and hurried on at the
top of his speed.</p>
<p>He felt now that the lives of at least three depended upon
his movements, and that it was no time to let the grass grow
under his feet.</p>
<p>The sun sunk lower and lower as he bounded onward, and
at last it was hidden by the treetops.</p>
<p>Night was now fast coming on, and the trail would be
hidden from his gaze.</p>
<p>Little more than a half-hour of daylight remained to
him, and every instant of the time must be improved, if
he hoped to accomplish the work he had laid out for himself.</p>
<p>As soon as the darkness was down it would be impossible
for him to follow the trail.</p>
<p>He would have to wait until the moon rose, and even then
it would be uncertain if he could keep it.</p>
<p>And then when he should come up with them it might be
too late for him to strike a blow in their behalf.</p>
<p>The sun went down, and the last rays of its light died out
of the forest.</p>
<p>The dusky shadows of evening took their place, stealing
upon him almost before he was aware of their presence.</p>
<p>It was all that he could do to mark their footsteps now,
among the withered leaves.</p>
<p>For once in his life the scout felt nervous, and fearful
that he should not accomplish the work he had laid out for
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a good deal for one more hour of daylight,&rdquo; he
muttered, to himself, as he made sure that he was going right
by bending down close to the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consarn it all, I bothered too long this morning. If I
had thought that the red-skins had been up to this game, I
would have been upon their heels before now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went on, but slowly, until at last the darkness was so
great that it was impossible longer to make out the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to wait till the moon rises,&rdquo; he said to himself.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no use to try and get on in this way. But what is
that? A light ahead, as sure as I&rsquo;m alive. Fortin ain&rsquo;t deserted
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
ye yet, Dick. But ye&rsquo;ve got to keep yer eyes and ears
open. You&rsquo;ve got a work afore ye that it won&rsquo;t do to blunder
in. The red-skins will give more for yer scalp than they
will for any other on the Scioto. You&rsquo;ve got to mind, Dick,
and keep it under yer cap and then it will be safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Communing thus with himself, the scout moved cautiously
forward toward the spot from whence the light proceeded.</p>
<p>It was on the line of the trail he had followed, and there
was no doubt in his mind that it marked the spot where the
savages were.</p>
<p>With footsteps so light that they gave out not the slightest
sound, he approached to within a half-dozen rods of the spot
from whence the light proceeded.</p>
<p>Here he paused and took in the scene which lay before
him.</p>
<p>In a little hollow a camp-fire was kindled, and about it
he counted seven savages.</p>
<p>The body of a deer lay beside it, and they were engaged
in cutting huge slices therefrom and roasting them over the
fire.</p>
<p>The light of the fire flashed out upon either side, but to
the dismay of the scout, he could see nothing of the captives
on either hand.</p>
<p>A sudden fear took possession of his mind.</p>
<p>Could it be that he was too late?</p>
<p>Had the red-skins already accomplished their terrible work?</p>
<p>Had they slain the captives before they had reached this
spot, and had he passed them in the darkness?</p>
<p>He shuddered at the thought and glanced behind him as
though he was almost fearful that they might be lying close
beside him.</p>
<p>But he saw nothing.</p>
<p>They had disappeared, but where?</p>
<p>With the utmost caution he crept nearer to the fire, keeping
well in the shadows of the trunks of the trees which
stretched out like giants on either hand.</p>
<p>Hardly a dozen yards now lay between him and the nearest
savage.</p>
<p>Suddenly a well-remembered voice broke upon his ear, dispelling
all his fears at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jerusalem and the Prophets, but this is a hard one! I
wish to mercy I was to hum in New Hampshire. I&rsquo;m as
hungry as a ba&rsquo;r, and that &rsquo;ere meat smells as good as aunt
Nancy&rsquo;s baked beans used to, when I was a boy. Don&rsquo;t you
think they mean to give us a mouthful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scout glanced toward a spot where the shadows fell
the thickest about the fire, and there he saw the outlines of
his friends&rsquo; forms, bound to the trunks of the saplings standing
there.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br />THE DEATH-DEALER AT WORK.</h2>
<p>The scout had never fancied the voice of the Yankee or
what he had to offer; but now it was real music to his ears,
for it told him that his fears were groundless, and that his
friends were yet alive.</p>
<p>He stood motionless trying to catch what might be said in
answer to this complaint on his part, but the rest of the captives
were silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have all of ye lost yer tongues?&rdquo; he exclaimed, a minute
later, &ldquo;and ain&rsquo;t ye got any appetite? I declare I&rsquo;m as hungry
as a mill-saw. Say, Mister Red-skin, ain&rsquo;t you going to
share that &rsquo;ere meat with us? Do the fair thing by us, and
I&rsquo;ll give ye a good trade arterwards. I&rsquo;ve got some &rsquo;tarnel
nice things in my pack, jest what you want for yer wives
and sweethearts. It&rsquo;ll make their eyes stick out to see the
ribbons and beads I&rsquo;ve got. Be kinder naberly now and give
us a hunk of that. I swan it makes my mouth water to look
at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you think of eating, when you know not but
what this may be the last hour we&rsquo;ve got to live?&rdquo; said the
voice of Sam Wilson. &ldquo;From what the chief said when he
parted us from Ruth, I do not think that they mean for us to
see the light of morning. I wish that we had died fighting
for our lives when they first came upon us, instead of trusting
to the promise of a savage. Ruth, then, would at least
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
have died with us, and so been saved from a fate far worse
than death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sob of anguish from the lip of a woman, told the scout
how the heart of Mrs. Wilson was torn with fears for her
child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you don&rsquo;t really believe they mean to kill us, do
ye?&rdquo; cried the Yankee. &ldquo;I guess if wuss comes to wuss, I
kin hire &rsquo;em not to. I believe if I had a chance to show &rsquo;em
what there is in my pack, I could bribe &rsquo;em to let us go. But
I declare if I was going to be killed I should rather have the
job done on a full stomach. Oh, dear! why in creation did
I ever come out into this heathen country. I shall be ruined,
I know I shall, afore I get out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I hope you will, you &rsquo;tarnal fool,&rdquo; muttered the scout
to himself. &ldquo;At any rate, I hope that pack of his will go
under. I do believe he&rsquo;d rather see &rsquo;em all murdered than
to lose that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wish of the Yankee was gratified at length. After
eating their fill, the savages offered a portion of what was
left to the captives. Mrs. Wilson could not touch a morsel,
and her husband and Ned partook but sparingly. But the
Yankee made up for them. He ate all that was offered him,
the moment his hands were set at liberty so that he could do
so, and begged that which they refused. When at last he
was through he declared that he felt better, and that if any
of them wanted to trade, he was ready for them. But for
this the savages were not apparently inclined, and his arms
were at once secured behind him in the same manner as before,
much to his discontent and disgust, especially when he
saw one of the savages lay hands upon his pack, and bringing
it close to the fire, undo it, and begin to display its contents
to his comrades.</p>
<p>In vain it was that he called upon them to desist. They
were deaf to his entreaties, and when at length his voice was
raised to a high pitch, one of the savages sprung from the
earth, and grasping his tomahawk, he whirled it about his
head, threatening him with instant death if he made again
the slightest sound.</p>
<p>After this the agony of the Yankee was ludicrous to behold.
He dared not speak, and as he saw his treasures one
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
after another in the hands of the savages, there was the most
doleful expression upon his face imaginable. Of his own
safety and that of his companions he gave not a thought.
He could think of nothing but the financial ruin to which he
would be subjected, did he lose his stock in trade, as he was
apparently about to do.</p>
<p>All this that was passing about the fire was observed by
the scout. Nothing escaped his eye from the place of his
concealment behind the trunk of a giant tree. There, silent
and immovable as the tree itself, he stood waiting for the
moment to come when he could strike for the deliverance of
the captives. To him, each savage about the fire was doomed.
In his own mind he had surely decreed their death.</p>
<p>His plan for their destruction was laid, and when the proper
moment came, he had no fears but what he should carry
it into execution.</p>
<p>More than the number now before him had died by his
unaided arm, on occasions before this.</p>
<p>The minutes glided on and told the hours, and at last
the evening was well advanced.</p>
<p>Satisfied at last with their inspection of the peddler&rsquo;s pack,
the savages replaced its contents&mdash;much to the relief of the
Yankee&mdash;and after assuring themselves that the captives were
firmly held in their thongs, they gathered about the fire for
rest.</p>
<p>From his hiding-place behind the tree, the Death-Dealer
watched their every movement.</p>
<p>He saw that the moment for action had nearly come&mdash;the
time for the deliverance of his friends was close at hand.</p>
<p>He knew that the savages had been without sleep the night
before, and when once they were buried in slumber they
would not easily awaken.</p>
<p>Minute after minute went by, and at last the savages were
as motionless as though they were held in the icy fetters of
death. Then, with his rifle in his left hand, and his knife
firmly clenched in his right, he glided from his hiding-place
behind the tree, and moved noiselessly toward the camp-fire.</p>
<p>Only a pale light flashed out from it now. The flames
had gone down, and a few smoldering embers alone marked
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
the spot where it had been, revealing but partly the forms
of the savages outstretched beside it.</p>
<p>The forms of the captives were hidden in darkness, but he
had marked well where they were, and could have laid his
hand upon them with his eyes shut.</p>
<p>Closer and closer he crept toward the unconscious savages.</p>
<p>He had doomed them all to death, and he was fearful lest
some one of them should escape him.</p>
<p>When within a couple of yards of the spot where they lay,
the one nearest to him stirred.</p>
<p>In an instant he was as motionless in his tracks as though
he had been turned to stone.</p>
<p>Could it be that the savage was awake, and that his quick
ear had detected his footsteps?</p>
<p>But no; the savage only turned a little, and then lay as
motionless as before.</p>
<p>Two more strides and the Death-Dealer stood by the side
of his victim.</p>
<p>His right arm was upraised, and the next instant it descended,
and the knife was driven to the hilt in the breast
of the red-skin.</p>
<p>Not so much as a groan escaped his lips. There was
a slight convulsive motion of his frame and then all was
still.</p>
<p>The Death-Dealer had struck his first blow strong and
well.</p>
<p>Stepping over the body of the lifeless savage, the scout
aimed a blow at the next who lay beside him.</p>
<p>His aim was as true as the other had been, and the spirit
of the savage followed that of his companion to the happy
hunting-grounds of his tribe.</p>
<p>Still not one of the warriors stirred. Buried in deep sleep
they lay unconscious of the presence of their terrible enemy.</p>
<p>Another blow descended, and another savage went the
way of his dead companions.</p>
<p>Three had fallen, while the remaining four still lay unconscious
of their fate.</p>
<p>Once more the knife descended to its deadly work and another
savage was numbered with the slain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>At that moment from some cause or another, a bright flame
shot up from the smoldering embers, illuminating the scene
about it.</p>
<p>It did not have the effect of awakening the surviving savages,
but the next moment a voice exclaimed, in startling
tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerusalem and the Prophets! What in nater is going
on here, I&rsquo;d like to know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice was that of Peleg Parker, and so shrill was it,
that it brought each of the surviving savages to his feet.</p>
<p>The scout saw his danger, and inwardly cursed the unlucky
tongue of the Yankee. But with the rapidity of lightning
he sprung upon the nearest warrior and plunged his
knife into his heart.</p>
<p>With a howl the Indian fell backward to the earth, with
the knife still in the wound, for the scout could not spare
the time to withdraw it.</p>
<p>The next instant a tomahawk whistled past his head, so
close that it seemed as though it had grazed the skin, but
left him unharmed.</p>
<p>Quick as thought he brought his rifle to his shoulder and
pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>Quick as his aim had been, it proved a true one, and the
red-skin fell with a bullet through his brain.</p>
<p>One only of the seven was left, but at a glance he had
taken in the fate of his comrades, and as if struck with horror
and the certainty of his own death did he stay to do battle
with the terrible Death-Dealer, he turned and fled.</p>
<p>A shout of exultation broke from the lips of the scout as
he saw himself thus master of the field, and it was echoed in
glad tones by the captives, who were thus assured of their deliverance
from the hands of their enemies.</p>
<p>At this moment the moon which had risen some time before,
now managed to throw a flood of silver light down
through the branches overhead, so that the spot where the
scout stood was brilliantly illuminated, and they were able
to recognize him and to see the work he had performed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven, it is the scout!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Wilson, as he
advanced toward the spot where they stood, after he had assured
himself that the fleeing savage meant to make them
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
further trouble. &ldquo;Oh, if Ruth was only with us now, how
happy I should be. But, alas! I fear that I shall never see
her more in this world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I guess you will if you only live long enough,&rdquo; said
the scout, as he cut the cords and set her free. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the
gal out of the clutches of Rushing Water afore I&rsquo;m two days
older, or else I shall never go for another red-skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God grant that you may!&rdquo; exclaimed the parents and Ned
in a breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I say amen to that,&rdquo; said the Yankee. &ldquo;But look
here, mister, jest cut these &rsquo;tarnal strings, will ye? They&rsquo;ve
nigh about cut into the bone, I du believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said amen afore you ought to jest now,&rdquo; muttered
the scout, as he paid his attention to the thongs that bound
Ned. &ldquo;You had ought to wait till you get through afore
you call out. If you had done it a minute sooner you would
have spoiled the whole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerusalem and the Prophets, who could help it?&rdquo; cried
Peleg. &ldquo;I should as quick have thought of seeing Satan himself
there among the red-skins as you at that time. But du
cut these &rsquo;tarnal bonds, will ye? I&rsquo;m mighty anxious &rsquo;bout
my pack thar. I&rsquo;m afraid the varmints carried off something
that belonged to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess thar didn&rsquo;t more than one of &rsquo;em carry any thing
a great ways. But I do believe that if the red-skins were a-scalping
ye, you would want to save yer pack in some way;
and I guess it is a darned sight more precious than your
body. If it ain&rsquo;t, it ain&rsquo;t worth much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite the entreaties of the Yankee, he was the last one
he freed from his bonds, and no sooner were his limbs at
liberty than he started off at once for the spot where the
pack was lying, so eager was he to be assured that nothing
had been taken therefrom. There couldn&rsquo;t have been very
well, for his eyes had been upon the savages at the time they
had been engaged in looking it over, though he had been
obliged to hold his tongue for fear that he might lose his
scalp.</p>
<p>The joy of the captives at their escape was great; but their
hearts were sad when they thought of Ruth, who was being
hurried along by her savage captor toward the lodges of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
tribe, even if by this time they had not already arrived
there.</p>
<p>In response to their inquiries, the scout told them of
his motions since he had parted with them, which are already
known to the reader, and then he demanded to know
why it was that Rushing Water had separated them from
Ruth.</p>
<p>In a few words they told him of their surprise and capture;
of the death that threatened them, and how it was
averted by the promise of Ruth, and also of the pledge the
chief had given. But as they went onward toward the Indian
village he seemed to repent of the promise he had made,
and at last determined at least that they should not go thither.
Neither would he set them at liberty, for fear that they might
try to rescue Ruth.</p>
<p>They were almost sure that they heard him give orders for
their destruction, and then Ruth was torn from them, and
they went their respective ways.</p>
<p>Hope of escape they had none, for they thought that unaided,
he would be powerless to afford them assistance, even
if he had escaped, which they were by no means sure
of. Aid they could expect in no other way, as they could
do nothing of themselves, and hope had well-nigh deserted
them.</p>
<p>While these several narrations had been going on the Yankee
had carefully examined his pack, and now, with it upon
his arm, he approached the spot where they were standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The darned snips didn&rsquo;t get any thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
&rsquo;spected nothing but what I was ruined when I see &rsquo;em afoul of
it. I&rsquo;m mighty glad they&rsquo;ve gone under for they had no
business to meddle with what didn&rsquo;t belong to &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad for your sake,&rdquo; said Ned, trying, but not succeeding,
in restraining the look of scorn upon his face, which
the moonlight might reveal to the Yankee. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s
all right, for you seem to think more of it than you do of
your life, or all of us put together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, I can&rsquo;t say but what I do. In there is every darned
cent I&rsquo;m worth in the world, unless it is my part of the old
rocky farm in New Hampshire. Thar&rsquo;s about a hundred
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
acres of that, but when the old folks drop off, it&rsquo;s got to be
divided between thirteen of us. Thar&rsquo;s Stephen, Solomon,
Daniel, Joshua&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go any further!&rdquo; cried Ned. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder you
want to keep your pack. Stick to it as long as you live, and
I hope it will be the making of your fortune. But now, Dick,
what is to be done? We&rsquo;re wasting time here. I&rsquo;m anxious
to be at work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; exclaimed Peleg. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m losing more&rsquo;n a dollar
a day. Thar ain&rsquo;t any trade in any of ye, and I shall be
glad when I get back, so that I can be earning an honest
penny. I wish to gracious that I was in Smith&rsquo;s Settlement
this very minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; cried the scout, angrily, &ldquo;or anywhere else
where I should never hear that tongue of yours ag&rsquo;in. Won&rsquo;t
you try if you can, and keep it still for five minutes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peleg gave a low whistle and was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ned, you are right,&rdquo; said the scout. &ldquo;We are losing
time here. We&rsquo;ve got now to find the other trail, and
do our best to get the gal out of the clutches of Rushing Water.
I &rsquo;spects we&rsquo;ve got a ticklish job to do it, &rsquo;specially if
he gets her to the village afore we come up with &rsquo;em. But
we&rsquo;ll do it, or the folks on the river sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t see our faces
ag&rsquo;in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we may,&rdquo; said Sam Wilson. &ldquo;But I know that
we&rsquo;ve got no easy task before us. If she was only with us
now, there is nothing in the world that I would not give.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or I,&rdquo; said Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wishing won&rsquo;t bring her here,&rdquo; said the scout. &ldquo;It
will take strong blows like them I&rsquo;ve give to-night to fetch
her, and I wouldn&rsquo;t wonder if as many more red-skins had to
go under as you can see stretched out there. Rushing Water
has set his mind upon the gal, and he&rsquo;ll keep her if he
can. But he&rsquo;ll find trouble in doing it or I miss my guess.
But there&rsquo;s danger to the gal, too, that she don&rsquo;t know of.
That red gal, who has a claim on him, will do all she can
to get her out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilson shuddered, and uttered a cry of grief and
alarm, at these words of the scout. In the hurry and excitement
of the last twenty-four hours she had forgotten this
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
danger of which the scout had spoken, when he had first
warned them of their danger. To save her from this they
must rescue her before she should enter the lodge of the
chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you propose to do now?&rdquo; asked Sam Wilson,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Start off at once, and hit the other trail as soon as we
can. But I&rsquo;m mighty &rsquo;fraid that we shall miss it, with only
the moonlight to show it to us. If we do, nothing can be
done till daylight, and by that time they will have got to the
village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let us start at once. Every moment we linger here
makes the odds greater against us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; replied the scout. &ldquo;I wish, marm, that you
were safe at the settlement, but you ain&rsquo;t and so will have to
go with us. But we will do our best to take care of ye.
If the woods wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t full of savages you and the peddler might
try and get thar, but I&rsquo;m afraid for ye to try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; said the Yankee. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m losing money
every step I follow ye round. This &rsquo;ere scrape will be the
ruination of me as sure as preaching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scout muttered something beneath his breath, the burden
of which was, that he hoped it would, and then he turned
to Sam Wilson and said, half-hesitatingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have half a mind that you leave Ruth to Ned and me,
and make the best of your way with your wife and this fellow
here to the settlements. If you kept a sharp look-out I
think that you could do it, and perhaps it would be best all
round in the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I can not go back and leave Ruth in the hands
of these red-skins. I must do what I can to help to save
her. Don&rsquo;t ask me to do this. Lead the way on at once,
and if we are of no service to you, we will be no drawback.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we will not,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilson. &ldquo;If I only had a
weapon, I think I could strike a blow for her deliverance myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have one of my pistols, marm, if you want it,&rdquo;
said the Yankee. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t use &rsquo;em both at once, and I&rsquo;m always
ready to oblige.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>No reply was made to this generous offer of Peleg. Hardly
a dozen more words passed between them, and then the scout
led the way again through the moonlit forest. The task
of rescuing Ruth had begun.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X.</span>
<br />IN THE SHADOW OF DEATH.</h2>
<p>Hope fairly abandoned the heart of Ruth when she was
separated from her friends, and obliged to go on her way
with Rushing Water with none of them beside her.</p>
<p>In vain it was that she had implored him not to separate
her from them; to remember the promise he had made her,
when they had fallen into his hands.</p>
<p>Her prayers and entreaties had no effect. He had promised,
he said, that their lives should be spared them, and he
had kept his word.</p>
<p>He had not said that they should remain in her company,
and it was not his will that they should do so, any longer.</p>
<p>He wished for none but her whom he had chosen for his
bride beside him, so he had sent the others away.</p>
<p>A terrible fear took possession of her mind that he had
sent them apart to take their lives, that it might not be done
before her very eyes.</p>
<p>Filled thus with terror and despair, she went onward,
while every step her strength seemed to fail her, while her
heart lay like lead in her bosom.</p>
<p>Through the rest of the day until night came on, she managed
to keep her feet, but when the shadows gathered thick
in the forest she sunk down upon the earth and declared that
she could go no further.</p>
<p>A short halt was made here, in which some food was prepared
and offered her; but she could not eat a mouthful.</p>
<p>It seemed to her that it would have choked her, but she
attempted to swallow a morsel.</p>
<p>Finding that it was in vain to urge her to do so further
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
and seeing also that she was unable to proceed of herself, the
chief raised her in his own strong arms, and again they went
forward.</p>
<p>He would not feel sure of his bride until he had her in his
own lodge and among his own people.</p>
<p>So long as they were in the forest, there was a chance that
she might be wrested from him.</p>
<p>He knew and feared the Death-Dealer, and it was in part
to mislead him that he had divided the party.</p>
<p>He knew that the dreaded scout was a host in himself, and
that his deadly blows fell ofttimes where and when they were
the least expected by his enemies.</p>
<p>Once among his own people and in the heart of their village,
he felt that he would be safe from him, and that there
would be no one who could wrest his chosen bride from him.</p>
<p>So all through the first hours of the night he hurried onward.
The moon rose and climbed high into the heavens
and when it had reached the zenith, the village was gained,
and with his almost unconscious burden in his arms he stood
before his lodge.</p>
<p>No human being save his companions were stirring about
him, and with a word he sent them to their several lodges,
and then lifting the skin that hung in the doorway he bore
Ruth within his own.</p>
<p>A lamp of rude construction, swinging from the roof, and
which emitted a pale light, half dispelled, half revealed the
darkness which filled the lodge.</p>
<p>Squatted almost beneath it, and apparently buried in
slumber, though gently swaying back and forth, was an old
Indian woman; Nekomis by name, who for many moons had
kept the lodge of the chief and prepared his food, when he
was not absent in the chase or upon the war-path.</p>
<p>Approaching a couch which lay in one corner of the apartment,
the chief placed his almost unconscious burden upon it,
and then stepping to the side of the Indian woman he said,
as he touched her upon the shoulder:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fingers of sleep must be heavy upon the eyes of Nekomis,
that she hears not the footsteps of the chief when he
comes. Let her awake, for he has need of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old squaw awoke with a start and staggered to her feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;You were sleeping soundly, good Nekomis,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;But wake. The chief has work for you to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spirit of sleep was heavy upon the eyelids of Nekomis,
and her ears were dull that she heard not the footsteps
of Rushing Water. But she is awake now and ready to do
his bidding. There is plenty of maize and venison in the
lodge and it shall soon be ready so that the chief may break
his fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rushing Water is not hungry. It&rsquo;s not to prepare him
food that he has roused Nekomis from her sleep. It is that
she may care for his pale-face bride whom he has brought
hither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old Indian woman gave a great start, and her eyes
followed the direction of his outstretched hand, as he pointed
toward the couch upon which Ruth lay. He did not see her
features as her eyes rested upon the form of the girl. If he
had he would have seen a look of most malignant hate resting
there, which could not help having awoke suspicions and
alarm in his breast, and made him fearful for the life of her
upon whom he had set his affections.</p>
<p>She did not speak, but stood with her eyes fixed upon
Ruth, as motionless as a statue.</p>
<p>Again the words of the chief fell but half heeded upon
her ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let Nekomis wait upon her, and see that she has every
wish. Let her watch by her side until the morning comes.
Let her stir not from the lodge, for she must answer for the
maiden with her life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again that look of hate came over the face of the Indian
woman. But it was gone in a moment as she answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nekomis will watch and care for her well. When the
chief comes in the morning he shall find her here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; answered the chief. &ldquo;The eyes of Rushing
Water are heavy for want of sleep. He will lie down in the
outer room till the sunlight comes again. The couch of Nekomis
will to-night be as soft to him as his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted the curtain which connected the two apartments,
and passing out, let it fall behind him. It was the one usually
occupied by old Nekomis, and throwing himself upon
the couch it contained, he was soon buried in slumber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>The old Indian woman stood where he had left her in the
main apartment. Her eyes were fixed upon the form of
Ruth, and she never stirred in her tracks more than though
she had been made of stone. But a fierce emotion shook her
frame, and it was evident that she was laboring under great
excitement. But the look upon her face as her eyes rested
upon the form of Ruth, told plainer than words could have
done the terrible hate with which she regarded her.</p>
<p>At length she turned her face away, and muttered to herself
so low that it would have been impossible for her words
to have reached the ears of Ruth, even had she been trying
to have caught the burden of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pale-face bride of the chief must die. Before the
light of the morning sun, she must be in the spirit-land.
Never will Nekomis see her in the lodge of the chief.
Minora is the bride the tribe has chosen for him, and none
other shall take her place. She is of the same blood of Nekomis,
and she shall never stand aside for one of a hated
race. She has willed it to be so, and the great Medicine of
the Rocks has furnished the deadly draught. Before the
morning light, the pale-face maiden shall have taken it, and
shall lay yonder, as pale and white as the winter&rsquo;s snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deadly light in her eyes grew brighter as she muttered
this to herself. Evidently she rejoiced in the work of
death and vengeance she had before her.</p>
<p>Glancing about again toward her victim, she saw that Ruth
had rallied from the stupor which she had seemed to be in,
and was now glancing about the lodge as though in search
of some one.</p>
<p>It might have been the chief she missed, and she waited
for her to speak if she would.</p>
<p>At length her eyes became fixed upon her, and she could
see that she was gazing upon her curiously.</p>
<p>As though emboldened by the sight of one of her own sex,
Ruth raised her hand and motioned for her to approach.</p>
<p>She obeyed her, and approaching the couch she squatted
down by her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; said Ruth, with wild eyes, as though she
hardly comprehended her situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pale-face maiden is in the lodge of the great chief.
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
Rushing Water has sought her in her home, and brought her
hither to be his bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth covered her face with her hands. She remembered
all now. What upon her first awaking from the sort of
swoon that oppressed her, had seemed a dream, was reality
now. She was hopelessly in the hands of her enemy.</p>
<p>She was silent for a few moments, and then hope whispered
again to her heart. Was it not possible that she might
escape him even now? Would not her companion listen to
her entreaties, and being melted thereby, help her to escape?
The hope was a faint one, but there could be no harm in
trying. If it amounted to nothing, her situation would be
no worse than it was now.</p>
<p>Turning eagerly to the old woman, she said, as she laid
her hand upon the brown and wrinkled one of her companion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indian woman likes not the pale-faces. That the
white maiden can see in her eyes. She had rather that the
chief of the tribe would bring to his lodge one of his own
race. It is only right that she should. Let her help the
white maiden to fly. She wishes not to mate with the chief.
There is one among her own people to whom she has given
her heart. Have mercy and save me from the fate Rushing
Water has in store for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This appeal she had uttered in a low but earnest tone, as
though she was fearful that the sound of her voice might
reach the ears of the chief, and now that she was through
she gazed up with such an appealing look into the face of
her companion that it would seem that none but a heart of
stone could resist it.</p>
<p>But it had no effect upon the heart of the wrinkled squaw.
She knew that there was no way for her to escape the fate
she dreaded, except by that to which she had doomed her.
Death would relieve her from it, and that alone. Had she
been so disposed she could not have assisted her to escape.
The eyes of the chief would have been upon their movement
and he would have brought her back, while she would
have been doomed to death for her treachery. No. There
was only one way by which Rushing Water could be foiled
in his purpose, and that was that the white maiden should die.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nekomis has heard the words of the white maiden. She
has spoken the truth. The Indian woman does not like the
pale-faces. Their heart is black and evil is in their thoughts.
She would see them scalped and their lodges burned above
their heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So fierce was her looks, and so wild her gestures, that
Ruth almost drew back in alarm. But she was glad it was
so, for perhaps now she would help her. The Indian woman
noticed her start of alarm and she softened a little in
her speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chief has chosen a pale-face for his bride, but the
tribe like it not. There are maidens fairer among them, than
she. If she were gone, the heart of Rushing Water might
turn again to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The words of the Indian woman are those of truth,&rdquo;
exclaimed Ruth, hopefully. &ldquo;Help me to escape and all may
be well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eyes of Rushing Water are sharp, and his ears are
open to the slightest sound. His anger is like the tempest
when it is abroad in the forest, and nothing can withstand
its fury. But let the white maiden content herself. She
shall never become the bride of the chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Could Ruth have seen the malevolent look that was upon
the face of her companion at this moment, she would have
been struck with horror. But her face was averted, and she
thought only of the promise her words implied. The hope
so faint within her grew stronger, and she exclaimed excitedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven bless you for your words,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But let
us lose not a moment&rsquo;s time. Let us flee from this spot
while we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pale-face maiden can not stir forth to-night. Morning
will come too soon, and the chief would be upon her
track. When all is well, Nekomis will do what she can for
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though disappointed, Ruth would fain accept this promise.
The Indian woman alone could help her now, and she must
cling to her, and the hope she gave her, and wait until such
time as she should set for her to try for her escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the white maiden seek slumber now. She needs it
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
to make her strong. Nekomis will watch by her side and
see that no harm shall come to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth sunk down wearily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must trust you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I do need sleep, and will
try to seek it. But first give me some water. I am very
thirsty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman arose and turned away from the couch.
The moment for which she had waited, had come. The
fatal draught which the Wizard had prepared could be given
now.</p>
<p>Her hand trembled as she took the vessel that contained
it, and brought it forward to the couch. Ruth rose up and
took it from her hand. Her mouth was parched and dry,
and she drained it eagerly to the very dregs. Could she but
have seen the look upon the face of the Indian woman she
would have dropped it as a thing of death. A look so exultant,
and so full of gratified rage would have struck terror
to her very soul.</p>
<p>But she saw it not; handing back the vessel to her attendant,
she sunk down again upon the couch, where she lay as
motionless as one dead.</p>
<p>Not once thereafter did she move so much as a hand; but
sunk into a deep, unbroken slumber, from which no sound or
word could have awakened her. The old Indian woman sat by
her side with her sharp, snake-like eyes fixed upon her face.
Little by little her breath grew fainter, until at last it seemed
to have left forever her pallid lips. The fatal draught
had done its work, and she lay as cold and motionless as
though formed of ice.</p>
<p>Then with an exultant look upon her face, the Indian woman
arose, and with noiseless steps glided forth from the lodge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI.</span>
<br />WHAT WILL HE DO WITH HER?</h2>
<p>Once out into the night, she hurried to another lodge
standing but a short distance away. Arrived at the entrance
she lifted the curtain and entered without ceremony.</p>
<p>It was so dark within that she could see but little; but she
appeared to be familiar with the way, and a few steps brought
her to the side of a couch upon which the dim outlines of a
form could be seen lying.</p>
<p>Stooping down she whispered a single word:
&ldquo;Minora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an instant the Indian girl was upon her feet confronting
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the white maiden come?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pale-face maiden is lying this moment in the lodge
of Rushing Water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did she come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a little ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has come to her death. She must not see the light
of the morning&rsquo;s sun. Far better for her that she had died
beneath the knife with kindred. Let the fatal draught be
given her at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hand of Nekomis has already held it to her lips, and
she has drained it to the very bottom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The heart of Minora is glad. She will soon be in the
spirit-land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is there already. Even now she is lying on
the couch of the chief, as pale and cold as the snow in winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nekomis has done her work well. Minora will not forget
what she owes to her when <i>she</i> goes to live in the lodge
of the chief. Does Rushing Water know that the white maiden
has left him forever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He&rsquo;s dreaming of her now in his sleep. He must
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
not know it until the Wizard is told, and has come hither.
Minora remembers the words he said. Let her fly to his
home among the rocks and tell him that the white maiden is
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Minora will go like the wind. Her heart is light now,
and her feet will be as fleet as those of the deer. In a little
time she shall dwell in the lodge of the chief where she has
long wished to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two women passed out into the night, and while Nekomis
returned to watch by the side of her lifeless charge,
Minora sped away through the forest toward the dwelling-place
of the Wizard among the rocks.</p>
<p>Her footsteps in due time brought her to the abode of the
Wizard, and the sentinel owl at once gave notice of her approach.
No one that ever visited the Wizard, be it by night
or day, ever found him asleep, and the Indian girl descried
him standing at the entrance of his cavern as though he had
not stirred from the spot since her last visit to the place.</p>
<p>She saluted him with profound reverence and then waited
for him to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has brought the Red Rose to the dwelling-place of
the Medicine? Has any of the tribe need of his skill to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Red Rose has come because the great Medicine bade
her do so when she could bring tidings of the pale-face
maiden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And can she to-night?&rdquo; asked the Wizard, hurriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Red Rose has said as much. The pale-face maiden
lies in the lodge of Rushing Water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the fatal draught been given her?&rdquo; he demanded,
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nekomis gave it to her with her own hand. The white
maiden drank it to the dregs and she now lies cold in death
upon the couch of the chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does Rushing Water know that he has been robbed
of his bride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. The chief sleeps a deep sleep and will not wake
until the rays of the sun are again streaming through the forest.
He gave the pale-face maiden to the charge of Nekomis
and bade her watch her through the night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>The Wizard was silent for a moment and then he spoke
out hastily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the Red Rose return at once and say to Nekomis, as
soon as the darkness has fled away let her call the chief to
the couch of the white maiden, that he may see that her
spirit has fled to the Shadowy Land. Let her tell him that
she knew nothing of her illness till she saw her lying dead;
but supposed that a heavy sleep was upon her. Then will
the chief want the Medicine, and he will be close at hand so
that he will not have to send hither for him. When the
Red Rose has told Nekomis this, let her go to her own lodge.
The chief must not know that she has been abroad to-night,
or he may think she has had a hand in this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ears of the Red Rose have heard, and her fleet footsteps
shall carry the message to Nekomis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned at once and bounded away through the forest,
anxious to reach the village before the day should begin to
break.</p>
<p>The gray light of the morning had begun to show in the
east when she summoned Nekomis from her watch beside the
couch of the dead.</p>
<p>Hastily telling her the message the Wizard had sent, she
retreated to her own lodge, fearful that the chief might awake
and find her there.</p>
<p>Nekomis went back to her place beside the couch and
looked upon the pallid face of her victim once. Then she
turned away, and lifting the curtain that divided the two
apartments, she stood beside the still sleeping chief.</p>
<p>Only for a moment did she hesitate to awaken him, and
then she touched him on the face, speaking his name at the
same moment.</p>
<p>He awoke with a start, and in a moment was upon his
feet, while an anxious look took its place upon his countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it that Nekomis wishes?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No harm
has come to the pale-face maiden, for if there has she shall
pay for it with her life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the chief come out and look upon her. Nekomis
thinks that her heart is broken, and that her life has fled
away to the spirit-land. She did think that her eyes were
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
closed in slumber, until the light of the morning came, and
showed her as pale and cold as the sun when the winter is
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pushing her aside with a force that almost sent her from
her feet, the chief sprung into the apartment and to the
couch on which lay the lifeless form of her who was so dear
to him, and upon whom he had set the highest wish of his
heart. One glance at her pallid face told him that Nekomis
was not mistaken. Kneeling down by her side he felt
that there was no sign of life there. The prize that had cost
him so much to obtain, had slipped through his hands when
he thought he had it surely in his grasp.</p>
<p>Springing to his feet again, he drew his knife and turned
it threateningly upon Nekomis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You let her die,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you shall follow her to
the spirit-land. Had you watched her as the panther does
its young, you would have seen when the death-sleep began
to grow upon her. But you did not, and now the worthless
life of an old squaw shall follow hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nekomis folded her hands upon her breast and gazed without
fear upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nekomis is ready to die,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But let the chief
make haste to send her to the spirit-land. Then he can send
for the great Medicine, who, it may be, can bring her back
to life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hand that held the weapon fell down to his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great Medicine shall come,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nekomis
shall live until he has done his best to bring her back to life.
If he can not she shall die then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rushed forth from the lodge, and sped away toward
the edge of the forest in the direction of the Wizard&rsquo;s
dwelling-place. But he had not gone far before to
his joy he saw the Medicine coming toward the village. In
a moment he was at his side urging him to hasten his footsteps.</p>
<p>In answer to his inquiries, he told him the state of affairs,
and then eagerly demanded if there was a chance to
hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Great Spirit holds the life of the red-man and the
white in his hand, and he calleth them away whenever he
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
chooses. The Medicine will do all that he can to bring the
pale-face maiden back to life. He knows many charms that
work well, and it may be that he can save her. But if the
Great Spirit hath taken her away the Medicine can avail her
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found Nekomis at the side of the couch when they
entered, and she stepped back at their approach. Had the
chief been less excited he might have noticed a look of intelligence
which passed between them. But he did not, and
the Medicine approached and bent above the form of his victim.</p>
<p>For the space of two minutes there was a breathless silence
within the lodge.</p>
<p>Then the Wizard straightened up and looked into the face
of the chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Medicine is not sure, but he thinks that the life of
the pale-face maiden has gone to the spirit-land. If he had
her in his cavern among the rocks he might work some
charms upon her that might bring her back to life. The
way thither is long, but if the chief will bear her there, he
will do his best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The arms of Rushing Water are strong and his steps are
fleet. He will bear her to the home of the Great Medicine,
if he will do what he can to restore her to him again. The
warriors are not yet astir, and it may be well that the tribe
knows not of this. Nekomis will keep the secret, or the
knife of the chief will find a way to make her do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gazed threateningly at her as he said this, and then
stooping down he raised the form of Ruth in his arms. He
shuddered as her lifeless form touched his breast, and then
he bore his burden out into the morning air.</p>
<p>There was indeed no one stirring as yet about the village,
and they were enabled to gain the cover of the forest without
being observed. Thence onward they went as fast as
they were able, and by the time the sun was an hour high,
they stood before the huge pile of stone that marked the
home of the Wizard.</p>
<p>The foot of no savage save his own had ever crossed the
threshold, and the chief looked into his face as though to
ask if he would be allowed to bear his burden in, and thereby
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
catch a glimpse of its mysteries. But this he evidently
would not admit for he held out his arms, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the chief give the pale-face maiden into the keeping
of the Medicine. He will work his strongest charms and do
all that he can to bring her back to life. Let him come
hither on the morrow at this time, and he shall know whether
the Great Spirit has claimed her for his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the cold and rigid form of Ruth in his arms, and
the chief watched him until he had disappeared within the
rocks. Then he turned his back upon the spot, and bent his
steps once more toward the village.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII.</span>
<br />WINDING UP THE WEB.</h2>
<p>Let us now return to the scout and his companions, and
see how it has fared with them since we parted company at
the spot where Dick had dealt the blows which delivered his
friends from the savages.</p>
<p>The reader will remember that they had turned their backs
upon this place; and had set out to endeavor to find the
other trail in the moonlight, in the hopes of following it on,
and overtaking Rushing Water before he could reach the Indian
village with his captive.</p>
<p>But that they had not succeeded in coming up with them,
the reader already knows, for he has seen what passed in the
lodge after they had gained it.</p>
<p>Aided by the moonlight, Dick had struck the trail without
much difficulty, and they had followed on, as fast as they could
under the circumstances.</p>
<p>But the chief and his companions were so far in advance
that they stood no show of coming up with them.</p>
<p>In fact the night was far gone when they drew near the
Indian village.</p>
<p>Long before they reached this point, the scout had become
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
satisfied that they were too late, and that if they accomplished
their object they had got to do it under more difficulties
than had yet beset them.</p>
<p>They had got to penetrate into the very lodge of Rushing
Water, which stood perhaps in the very heart of the village.</p>
<p>There would not be time to accomplish this to-night, even
if it could be done successfully.</p>
<p>They must lie quiet somewhere in the depth of the forest
and wait until the darkness of another night.</p>
<p>They followed the trail almost to the verge of the village,
so impatient were his companions to rescue Ruth if the thing
lay in their power; and then convinced that it did not, in
the remaining hours of that night at least, they were ready
to comply with what the scout had to propose.</p>
<p>This was that they should retire back from the village for
something like a mile and lie through the day in some darksome
covert, where there would be little likelihood of their
being discovered by the savages.</p>
<p>This plan was now carried into effect and by the time the
day had fairly broke they were snugly ensconced in their
hiding-place.</p>
<p>The sun rose above the tree-tops, giving promise of a beautiful
day, and over and over again did they wish that Ruth
was with them that they might be hurrying toward a place
of safety instead of lying idly there.</p>
<p>Fears that she would never be restored to them oppressed
the heart of the mother. The chief had her now securely
in his power and how were they ever to tear her from his
clutches?</p>
<p>It seemed impossible to her that so few of them could do it.</p>
<p>Yet they were determined to accomplish the task before
them, or lose their lives in the attempt.</p>
<p>The scout knew that it could not be done by mere strength
of arms alone; but more than once had he accomplished his
ends by outwitting the savages and he meant to succeed in
this way now.</p>
<p>Slowly the minutes went on and higher and higher the sun
rose up into the cloudless sky.</p>
<p>Suddenly the sound of a footstep struck upon the watchful
ear of the scout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Glancing hastily out from their hiding-place, he saw a savage
slowly advancing toward the spot where they lay.</p>
<p>He did not seem to be seeking for any trail; but his head
was bowed and his eyes fixed upon the earth as though some
grave subject occupied his mind.</p>
<p>Sam Wilson&rsquo;s gaze fell upon him a moment after, and as
it did so he gave a great start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Rushing Water,&rdquo; he exclaimed in surprise. &ldquo;Where
is Ruth? What could he have done with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; exclaimed the scout in a whisper. &ldquo;It
is the chief himself. Now, boys, he must not leave us alive;
but we must get him into our hands unharmed, if the thing
can be done. When he is close to us we must spring out
upon him. If we can get hold on him we are all right.
Stand by me, and I guess there is enough of us here to match
any savage that ever burned a cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly the savage came on, apparently in deep thought,
and unconscious of all that was passing around him. They
could see a look upon his face that told something pained and
troubled him.</p>
<p>Nearer and nearer he came, and at last the instant arrived
for them to act.</p>
<p>Noiselessly they crept forth from their hiding-place and approached
their intended victim.</p>
<p>Had he raised his eyes he must have seen them, but he
did not.</p>
<p>With a spring like that of a panther the scout bounded
upon him, and his enemies followed his example.</p>
<p>The struggle was a short one.</p>
<p>With the odds against him, and taken thus by surprise, the
chief could make but slight resistance.</p>
<p>In a minute&rsquo;s time he was thrown to the earth and his
hands and feet firmly secured with strong thongs which the
scout produced from about his person.</p>
<p>Not a word did the scout utter until this was accomplished,
and the wily savage lay a helpless prisoner before
them.</p>
<p>Then with his knife held menacingly above his breast, the
scout demanded, while the rest of the party with eager looks
gathered about them:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the pale-face maiden? Speak! and let your
words be true ones, or you die at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rushing Water is not afraid to die. The words of the
Death-Dealer can not frighten him. He will speak the same
as though they were not sounding in his ears. The Death-Dealer
is a great warrior, but the chief is not a squaw that
he should be afraid of his words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilson knelt down by his side and cried, appealingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is my daughter? Tell me that she is unharmed,
and restore her again to my arms, and no harm shall come
to you. Only give her back to us, and we will forgive
you the loss of our home, and all else that you have done to
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pale-face mother can not have her child again. The
chief has not the power to give her again into her arms if
he would. The Great Spirit has called her home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Heaven!&rdquo; cried the agonized mother. &ldquo;You do
not mean to say that she is dead? that you have killed
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned Tapley drew his knife, and with a face as pale as
death, would have sprung forward and plunged it into the
heart of the savage, had not the strong arm of the scout held
him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him speak, youngster,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If he has harmed
so much as a hair of her head, we will have vengeance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The white maiden did not die by my hand,&rdquo; said the
chief, calmly. &ldquo;The Great Spirit himself called her home.
When the daylight came, she lay upon her couch as white
and cold as the snow of winter. The Great Spirit himself
knows that Rushing Water harmed her not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wail of agony broke from the lips of the parents, and
Mrs. Wilson staggered and would have fallen to the earth
had not her husband supported her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you killed her as surely as though your hand had
plunged a knife into her heart, and for this you shall die!&rdquo;
cried Ned, as he made another effort to deal the helpless
savage a blow with his knife. But this he was again prevented
from doing by the scout, who exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is the white maiden lying now? We would
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
look upon her, that we may know that your words are not
lying ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The form of the White Rose lies in the cavern of the
great Medicine, beneath the rocks. Rushing Water has
carried her there to see if she can not be brought back to
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the spot,&rdquo; cried the scout. &ldquo;Let us go there at
once, and see whether this red-skin is lying or not. He&rsquo;s
bound so securely that he cannot escape us, and we shall find
him here when we come back. Let him live till then, that
we may know how to deal with him. If by his means
Ruth has died, a dozen deaths would not be enough for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned was the last to assent to this. He was fearful that in
some way the chief might escape him. But he agreed to it
at last, after he had seen the savage gagged, so that it was
impossible for him to call any one to his assistance.</p>
<p>With hearts oppressed by sorrow and grief they hurried
away toward the dwelling-place of the Wizard. Arrived
there, they found that his brute sentinel had given notice of
their approach, and that he was standing in his accustomed
place to receive them.</p>
<p>His astonishment was great when he saw who his visitors
were, and their errand he divined at once, before the scout
could open his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pale-faces have come for the white maiden,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;It is well. The Medicine is glad to see them.
When the sun is half-way home in the sky, she shall go with
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cry of joy and gladness broke from the lips of all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God! my child is then alive,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Wilson,
in a tone of joyous thankfulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The white maiden lives, but her strength has not come
back to her yet. But let the pale-faces enter so that the eyes
of the red-men may not see them. Then the Medicine will
tell them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They followed him into a sort of outer cavern, which was
partly illuminated by a small fire that was burning in one
corner. Another passage led further into the rocks, but
thither they were forbidden to go. A panther sat therein as
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
though to guard the mysteries that lay beyond, and who
growled savagely at this unwonted intrusion, while perched
upon a projecting point of rock over his head was a huge
owl who looked down upon them with his great staring eyes,
and who ruffled its feathers as though it, too, did not like the
appearance of the strangers.</p>
<p>At a word from the Wizard, his companions were mute
and motionless; and then he turned toward a couch in one
corner, which, owing to the darkness, they had not perceived
until this moment.</p>
<p>Stretched thereon was the form of Ruth, and no sooner
did Mrs. Wilson behold it, than she sprung forward and
clasped it in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth, my Ruth!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Speak to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said the girl, faintly. &ldquo;Oh, I am so glad that
you have come,&rdquo; and she twined her arms about her neck.</p>
<p>Each one of the party now presented themselves, and a
scene of joyous greeting followed that our pen can not describe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is this?&rdquo; demanded the scout, turning upon the
Wizard. &ldquo;With my own ears I heard you promise the Indian
girl that little Ruth here should die, should Rushing
Water bring her to his lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so she has to them,&rdquo; answered the Wizard. &ldquo;I
worked for the good of my people and that of the pale-faces
at the same time. I knew that the red-men wanted not the
chief to take a pale-face for a bride; but he was so set upon
it that he would have his own will. I prepared a potion for
her, that I knew would make her seem as though the Great
Spirit had called her home. Nekomis, the old woman that
cares for the lodge of the chief, gave it to her, and then called
upon him to look upon his dead bride. He was well-nigh
stricken with grief, and came for me to try to restore her to
life. I had her brought hither, and when he had gone, not
to return until the morrow, I gave her another potion which
restored her to life. In a little while she will be as strong
as ever again, and then you must fly with her, before the
chief comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerusalem! I guess that won&rsquo;t be till somebody lets him
loose,&rdquo; exclaimed the Yankee, who had been staring about
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
him with all his eyes, and who for a wonder had maintained
silence until this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does the pale-face mean?&rdquo; demanded the Wizard.
&ldquo;The white warriors have not harmed him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few words the scout told him of the condition in
which they had left the chief, and then added, that he desired
the Wizard to set him free when it could be done in
safety to themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The white warriors have done well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
Medicine will see to him. The white maiden shall be as
dead to him, and by and by he will wed with Minora, the
Red Rose of the tribe, and happiness will come to his lodge
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, I swan you&rsquo;ve got a long head on yer shoulders,&rdquo;
exclaimed the Yankee. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve planned matters pretty
shrewd, I&rsquo;ll be darned if you ain&rsquo;t. But, say, how&rsquo;ll you
trade that owl of your&rsquo;n for some of the notions in my pack?
I should like to have him stuffed, and kerry him home as a
sort of trophy of this &rsquo;ere scrape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This proposition for a trade, on the part of Peleg, the
Wizard declined, and he now turned his attention to the further
recovery of Ruth; and so successful was he that in a
couple of hours her strength was in a great measure restored
to her, and she declared that she was able to commence her
homeward journey at any time, when they were ready to depart.
This they were glad to do at once, and taking leave
of the Wizard, with many thanks on their part for his kind
offices, they went forth from the cavern, and set their faces
once more toward the settlement.</p>
<p>An hour after their departure, the Wizard stood by the
side of the captive chief. He had no difficulty in finding the
spot, for the scout had described it so that he could not miss
it. He looked up in the face of the Medicine as he cut the
bonds that held him, mutely asking the question, the answer
he so much feared to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The white maiden is gone, and none of the arts of the
Medicine can bring her back,&rdquo; he said, simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the pale-faces, her friends&mdash;where are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bearing her back to their home that the chief made desolate,
that she may be near them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>The chief asked no more questions. Turning his back
upon the Wizard, he strode away in the direction of the Indian
village, fully convinced that the pale-face upon whom
he had set his heart, had gone to the spirit land.</p>
<p>He did not harm Nekomis as he had threatened to. On
the contrary she kept his lodge as usual, until, before a year
had gone round, he brought Minora to keep it for him. He
was happy and contented with her. The Wizard kept his secret
well, and none among the savages ever knew of the part
he had played.</p>
<p>On through the forest our friends went, rejoicing in their
escape from the fiery furnace with hardly so much as a singe
upon their garments.</p>
<p>The Yankee clung to his pack, which he had stuck to
through thick and thin, and which he was at last bearing out
triumphantly. Ruth bore the fatigue well, helped along as
she was by the hand and strength of her lover, and in due
time the nearest settlement was reached, and they were safe
from any further dangers.</p>
<p>Sam Wilson did not return to his clearing, and so the
cabin in the wilderness was not re&euml;rected.</p>
<p>He had experienced dangers enough from living apart from
the body of the settlers, and was now content to abide with
them. A piece of land was taken up close to them, and two
cabins erected thereon. Not long after they were completed,
Ned Tapley and Ruth were married and took up their abode
in one of them, while the parents of the latter dwelt in
the other.</p>
<p>Rushing Water neither of them saw again. Whether he
was ever undeceived they had no means of knowing. Happy
themselves, they were willing that he and Minora should be
likewise.</p>
<p>Dick, the Death-Dealer, was ever a prized friend to them;
and they were glad to have him take up his abode with them
whenever he was not abroad upon his work in the forest.
Many were the timely services he performed for all of his
settlers, and he was looked upon as the benefactor of them
all.</p>
<p>It may be some satisfaction to our readers to know that the
Yankee made one trade with our friends. Ruth&rsquo;s wedding-dress
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
was purchased of him, and though he said that he
was selling it so low for friendship&rsquo;s sake that he was ruining
himself, he was afterward heard to chuckle and declare that
he had &ldquo;made a darned handsome thing out of it,&rdquo; as doubtless
he had.</p>
<p>Whether he ever went back to New Hampshire is unknown;
but whether he did, or remained in the West, there
is one thing sure: he looked out for Number One on all occasions,
and that he and his pack stuck together through thick
and thin.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
